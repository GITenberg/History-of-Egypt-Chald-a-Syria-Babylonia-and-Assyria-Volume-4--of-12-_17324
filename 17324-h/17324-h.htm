    </p>
    <p>
      <i>SYRIA: THE PART PLAYED BY IT IN THE HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT WORLD&mdash;
      BABYLON AND THE FIRST CHALDÆAN EMPIRE&mdash;THE DOMINION OF THE HYKSÔS:
      ÂHMOSIS.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Syria, owing to its geographical position, condemned to be subject to
      neighbouring powers-Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon, the valley of the Orontes and
      of the Litâny, and surrounding regions: the northern table-land, the
      country about Damascus, the Mediterranean coast, the Jordan and the Dead
      Sea-Civilization and primitive inhabitants, Semites and Asiatics: the
      almost entire absence of Egyptian influence, the predominance of that of
      Chaldæa.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Babylon, its ruins and its environs&mdash;It extends its rule over
      Mesopotamia; its earliest dynasty and its struggle with Central
      Chaldæa-Elam, its geographical position, its peoples; Kutur-Nakhunta
      conquers Larsam-Bimsin (Eri-Aku); Khammurabi founds the first Babylonian
      empire; Ids victories, his buildings, his canals&mdash;The Elamites in
      Syria: Kudurlagamar&mdash;Syria recognizes the authority of Hammurabi and
      his successors.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Hyksôs conquer Egypt at the end of the XIVth dynasty; the founding
      of Avaris&mdash;Uncertainty both of ancients and moderns with regard to
      the origin of the Hyksôs: probability of their being the Khati&mdash;Their
      kings adopt the manners and civilization of the Egyptians: the monuments
      of Khiani and of Apôphis I. and II&mdash;The XVth dynasty.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semitic incursions following the Hyksôs&mdash;The migration of the
      Phoenicians and the Israelites into Syria: Terah, Abraham and his sojourn
      in the land of Canaan&mdash;Isaac, Jacob, Joseph: the Israelites go down
      into Egypt and settle in the land of Goshen.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thébes revolts against the Hyksôs: popular traditions as to the origin
      of the war, the romance of Apôphis and Saquinri&mdash;The Theban
      princesses and the last Icings of the XVIIth dynasty: Tiûdqni Kamosis,
      Ahmosis I.&mdash;The lords of El-Kab, and the part they played during the
      war of independence&mdash;The taking of Avaris and the expulsion of the
      Ilylcsôs.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The reorganization of Egypt&mdash;Ahmosis I. and his Nubian wars, the
      reopening of the quarries of Turah&mdash;Amenôthes I. and his mother
      Nofrîtari: the jewellery of Queen Âhhotpû&mdash;The wars of Amenôthes I.,
      the apotheosis of Nofrîtari&mdash;The accession of Thûtmosis I. and the
      re-generation of Egypt.</i>

      CHAPTER I<br /> <br /> THE FIRST CHALDÆAN EMPIRE AND THE HYKSÔS IN EGYPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Syria: the part played by it in the ancient world&mdash;Babylon and the
      first Chaldæan empire&mdash;The dominion of the Hyksôs: Âhmosis.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Some countries seem destined from their origin to become the battle-fields
      of the contending nations which environ them. Into such regions, and to
      their cost, neighbouring peoples come from century to century to settle
      their quarrels and bring to an issue the questions of supremacy which
      disturb their little corner of the world. The nations around are eager for
      the possession of a country thus situated; it is seized upon bit by bit,
      and in the strife dismembered and trodden underfoot: at best the only
      course open to its inhabitants is to join forces with one of its invaders,
      and while helping the intruder to overcome the rest, to secure for
      themselves a position of permanent servitude. Should some unlooked-for
      chance relieve them from the presence of their foreign lord, they will
      probably be quite incapable of profiting by the respite which fortune puts
      in their way, or of making any effectual attempt to organize themselves in
      view of future attacks. They tend to become split up into numerous rival
      communities, of which even the pettiest will aim at autonomy, keeping up a
      perpetual frontier war for the sake of becoming possessed of or of
      retaining a glorious sovereignty over a few acres of corn in the plains,
      or some wooded ravines in the mountains. Year after year there will be
      scenes of bloody conflict, in which petty armies will fight petty battles
      on behalf of petty interests, but so fiercely, and with such furious
      animosity, that the country will suffer from the strife as much as, or
      even more than, from an invasion. There will be no truce to their
      struggles until they all fall under the sway of a foreign master, and,
      except in the interval between two conquests, they will have no national
      existence, their history being almost entirely merged in that of other
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From remote antiquity Syria was in the condition just described, and thus
      destined to become subject to foreign rule. Chaldæa, Egypt, Assyria, and
      Persia presided in turn over its destinies, while Macedonia and the
      empires of the West were only waiting their opportunity to lay hold of it.
      By its position it formed a kind of meeting-place where most of the
      military nations of the ancient world were bound sooner or later to come
      violently into collision. Confined between the sea and the desert, Syria
      offers the only route of easy access to an army marching northwards from
      Africa into Asia, and all conquerors, whether attracted to Mesopotamia or
      to Egypt by the accumulated riches on the banks of the Euphrates or the
      Nile, were obliged to pass through it in order to reach the object of
      their cupidity. It might, perhaps, have escaped this fatal consequence of
      its position, had the formation of the country permitted its tribes to
      mass themselves together, and oppose a compact body to the invading hosts;
      but the range of mountains which forms its backbone subdivides it into
      isolated districts, and by thus restricting each tribe to a narrow
      existence maintained among them a mutual antagonism. The twin chains, the
      Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, which divide the country down the centre,
      are composed of the same kind of calcareous rocks and sandstone, while the
      same sort of reddish clay has been deposited on their slopes by the
      glaciers of the same geological period.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Drake remarked in the Lebanon several varieties of
     limestone, which have been carefully catalogued by Blanche
     and Lartet. Above these strata, which belong to the Jurassic
     formation, come reddish sandstone, then beds of very hard
     yellowish limestone, and finally marl. The name Lebanon, in
     Assyrian Libnana, would appear to signify &ldquo;the white
     mountain;&rdquo; the Amorites called the Anti-Lebanon Saniru,
     Shenir, according to the Assyrian texts and the Hebrew
     books.
</pre>
    <p>
      Arid and bare on the northern side, they sent out towards the south
      featureless monotonous ridges, furrowed here and there by short narrow
      valleys, hollowed out in places into basins or funnel-shaped ravines,
      which are widened year by year by the down-rush of torrents. These ridges,
      as they proceed southwards, become clothed with verdure and offer a more
      varied outline, the ravines being more thickly wooded, and the summits
      less uniform in contour and colouring. Lebanon becomes white and
      ice-crowned in winter, but none of its peaks rises to the altitude of
      perpetual snows: the highest of them, Mount Timarun, reaches 10,526 feet,
      while only three others exceed 9000.* Anti-Lebanon is, speaking generally,
      1000 or 1300 feet lower than its neighbour: it becomes higher, however,
      towards the south, where the triple peak of Mount Hermon rises to a height
      of 9184 feet. The Orontes and the Litâny drain the intermediate space. The
      Orontes rising on the west side of the Anti-Lebanon, near the ruins of
      Baalbek, rushes northwards in such a violent manner, that the dwellers on
      its banks call it the rebel&mdash;Nahr el-Asi.** About a third of the way
      towards its mouth it enters a depression, which ancient dykes help to
      transform into a lake; it flows thence, almost parallel to the sea-coast,
      as far as the 36th degree of latitude. There it meets the last spurs of
      the Amanos, but, failing to cut its way through them, it turns abruptly to
      the west, and then to the south, falling into the Mediterranean after
      having received an increase to its volume from the waters of the Afrîn.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Bukton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. p. 88, attributed
     to it an altitude of 9175 English feet; others estimate it
     at 10,539 feet. The mountains which exceed 3000 metres are
     Dahr el-Kozîb, 3046 metres; Jebel-Mislriyah, 3080 metres;
     and Jebel-Makhmal or Makmal, 3040 metres. As a matter of
     fact, these heights are not yet determined with the accuracy
     desirable.

     ** The Egyptians knew it in early times by the name of
     Aûnrati, or Araûnti; it is mentioned in Assyrian
     inscriptions under the name of Arantû. All are agreed in
     acknowledging that this name is not Semitic, and an Aryan
     origin is attributed to it, but without convincing proof;
     according to Strabo (xvi. ii. § 7, p. 750), it was
     originally called Typhon, and was only styled Orontes after
     a certain Orontes had built the first bridge across it. The
     name of Axios which it sometimes bears appears to have been
     given to it by Greek colonists, in memory of a river in
     Macedonia. This is probably the origin of the modern name of
     Asi, and the meaning, <i>rebellious river</i>, which Arab
     tradition attaches to the latter term, probably comes from a
     popular etymology which likened Axios to Asi, the
     identification was all the easier since it justifies the
     epithet by the violence of its current.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Litâny rises a short distance from the Orontes; it flows at first
      through a wide and fertile plain, which soon contracts, however, and
      forces it into a channel between the spurs of the Lebanon and the Galilæan
      hills. The water thence makes its way between two cliffs of perpendicular
      rock, the ravine being in several places so narrow that the branches of
      the trees on the opposite sides interlace, and an active man could readily
      leap across it. Near Yakhmur some detached rocks appear to have been
      arrested in their fall, and, leaning like flying buttresses against the
      mountain face, constitute a natural bridge over the torrent. The basins of
      the two rivers lie in one valley, extending eighty leagues in length,
      divided by an almost imperceptible watershed into two beds of unequal
      slope. The central part of the valley is given up to marshes. It is only
      towards the south that we find cornfields, vineyards, plantations of
      mulberry and olive trees, spread out over the plain, or disposed in
      terraces on the hillsides. Towards the north, the alluvial deposits of,
      the Orontes have gradually formed a black and fertile soil, upon which
      grow luxuriant crops of cereals and other produce. Cole-Syria, after
      having generously nourished the Oriental empires which had preyed upon
      her, became one of the granaries of the Roman world, under the capable
      rule of the Cæsars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Syria is surrounded on all sides by countries of varying aspect and soil.
      That to the north, flanked by the Amanos, is a gloomy mountainous region,
      with its greatest elevation on the seaboard: it slopes gradually towards
      the interior, spreading out into chalky table-lands, dotted over with bare
      and rounded hills, and seamed with tortuous valleys which open out to the
      Euphrates, the Orontes, or the desert. Vast, slightly undulating plains
      succeed the table-lands: the soil is dry and stony, the streams are few in
      number and contain but little water. The Sajur flows into the Euphrates,
      the Afrîn and the Karasu when united yield their tribute to the Orontes,
      while the others for the most part pour their waters into enclosed basins.
      The Khalus of the Greeks sluggishly pursues its course southward, and
      after reluctantly leaving the gardens of Aleppo, finally loses itself on
      the borders of the desert in a small salt lake full of islets: about
      halfway between the Khalus and the Euphrates a second salt lake receives
      the Nahr ed-Dahab, the &ldquo;golden river.&rdquo; The climate is mild, and the
      temperature tolerably uniform. The sea-breeze which rises every afternoon
      tempers the summer heat: the cold in winter is never piercing, except when
      the south wind blows which comes from the mountains, and the snow rarely
      lies on the ground for more than twenty-four hours. It seldom rains during
      the autumn and winter months, but frequent showers fall in the early days
      of spring. Vegetation then awakes again, and the soil lends itself to
      cultivation in the hollows of the valleys and on the table-lands wherever
      irrigation is possible. The ancients dotted these now all but desert
      spaces with wells and cisterns; they intersected them with canals, and
      covered them with farms and villages, with fortresses and populous cities.
      Primæval forests clothed the slopes of the Amanos, and pinewood from this
      region was famous both at Babylon and in the towns of Lower Chaldæa. The
      plains produced barley and wheat in enormous quantities, the vine throve
      there, the gardens teemed with flowers and fruit, and pistachio and olive
      trees grew on every slope. The desert was always threatening to invade the
      plain, and gained rapidly upon it whenever a prolonged war disturbed
      cultivation, or when the negligence of the inhabitants slackened the work
      of defence: beyond the lakes and salt marshes it had obtained a secure
      hold. At the present time the greater part of the country between the
      Orontes and the Euphrates is nothing but a rocky table-land, ridged with
      low hills and dotted over with some impoverished oases, excepting at the
      foot of Anti-Lebanon, where two rivers, fed by innumerable streams, have
      served to create a garden of marvellous beauty. The Barada, dashing from
      cascade to cascade, flows for some distance through gorges before emerging
      on the plain: scarcely has it reached level ground than it widens out,
      divides, and forms around Damascus a miniature delta, into which a
      thousand interlacing channels carry refreshment and fertility. Below the
      town these streams rejoin the river, which, after having flowed merrily
      along for a day&rsquo;s journey, is swallowed up in a kind of elongated chasm
      from whence it never again emerges. At the melting of the snows a regular
      lake is formed here, whose blue waters are surrounded by wide grassy
      margins &ldquo;like a sapphire set in emeralds.&rdquo; This lake dries up almost
      completely in summer, and is converted into swampy meadows, filled with
      gigantic rushes, among which the birds build their nests, and multiply as
      unmolested as in the marshes of Chaldæa. The Awaj, unfed by any tributary,
      fills a second deeper though smaller basin, while to the south two other
      lesser depressions receive the waters of the Anti-Lebanon and the Hauran.
      Syria is protected from the encroachments of the desert by a continuous
      barrier of pools and beds of reeds: towards the east the space reclaimed
      resembles a verdant promontory thrust boldly out into an ocean of sand.
      The extent of the cultivated area is limited on the west by the narrow
      strip of rock and clay which forms the littoral. From the mouth of the
      Litâny to that of the Orontes, the coast presents a rugged, precipitous,
      and inhospitable appearance. There are no ports, and merely a few
      ill-protected harbours, or narrow beaches lying under formidable
      headlands. One river, the Nahr el-Kebir, which elsewhere would not attract
      the traveller&rsquo;s attention, is here noticeable as being the only stream
      whose waters flow constantly and with tolerable regularity; the others,
      the Leon, the Adonis,* and the Nahr el-Kelb,* can scarcely even be called
      torrents, being precipitated as it were in one leap from the Lebanon to
      the Mediterranean. Olives, vines, and corn cover the maritime plain, while
      in ancient times the heights were clothed with impenetrable forests of
      oak, pine, larch, cypress, spruce, and cedar. The mountain range drops in
      altitude towards the centre of the country and becomes merely a line of
      low hills, connecting Gebel Ansarieh with the Lebanon proper; beyond the
      latter it continues without interruption, till at length, above the narrow
      Phoenician coast road, it rises in the form of an almost insurmountable
      wall. Near to the termination of Coele-Syria, but separated from it by a
      range of hills, there opens out on the western slopes of Hermon a valley
      unlike any other in the world. At this point the surface of the earth has
      been rent in prehistoric times by volcanic action, leaving a chasm which
      has never since closed up. A river, unique in character&mdash;the Jordan&mdash;flows
      down this gigantic crevasse, fertilizing the valley formed by it from end
      to end.***

     * The Adonis of classical authors is now Nahr-Ibrahim. We
     have as yet no direct evidence as to the Phoenician name of
     this river; it was probably identical with that of the
     divinity worshipped on its banks. The fact of a river
     bearing the name of a god is not surprising: the Belos, in
     the neighbourhood of Acre, affords us a parallel case to the
     Adonis.

     ** The present Nahr el-Kelb is the Lykos of classical
     authors. The Due de Luynes thought he recognized a
     corruption of the Phoenician name in that of Alcobile, which
     is mentioned hereabouts in the Itinerary of the pilgrim of
     Bordeaux. The order of the Itinerary does not favour this
     identification, and Alcobile is probably Jebail: it is none
     the less probable that the original name of the Nahr el Kelb
     contained from earliest times the Phoenician equivalent of
     the Arab word <i>kelb</i>, &ldquo;dog.&rdquo;

      The water collects in an oval rocky basin hidden by bushes, and flows down
      among the brushwood to join the Nahr el-Hasbany, which brings the waters
      of the upper torrents to swell its stream; a little lower down it mingles
      with the Banias branch, and winds for some time amidst desolate marshy

      Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than the country on either

      behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating and
      intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the Dead

    <p>
      The whole of this district forms a little world in itself, whose
      inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits, live a life of isolation, with
      no ambition to take part in general history. West of the Jordan, a
      confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered slopes
      affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and
      olives. One ridge&mdash;Mount Carmel&mdash;detached from the principal
      chain near the southern end of the Lake of Genesareth, runs obliquely to
      the north-west, and finally projects into the sea. North of this range
      extends Galilee, abounding in refreshing streams and fertile fields; while
      to the south, the country falls naturally into three parallel zones&mdash;the
      littoral, composed alternately of dunes and marshes&mdash;an expanse of
      plain, a &ldquo;Shephelah,&rdquo; dotted about with woods and watered by intermittent
      rivers,&mdash;and finally the mountains. The region of dunes is not
      necessarily barren, and the towns situated in it&mdash;Gaza, Jaffa,
      Ashdod, and Ascalon&mdash;are surrounded by flourishing orchards and
      gardens. The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground
      needing no manure and very little labour. The higher ground and the
      hill-tops are sometimes covered with verdure, but as they advance
      southwards, they become denuded and burnt by the sun. The valleys, too,
      are watered only by springs, which are dried up for the most part during
      the summer, and the soil, parched by the continuous heat, can scarcely be
      distinguished from the desert. In fact, till the Sinaitic Peninsula and
      the frontiers of Egypt are reached, the eye merely encounters desolate and
      almost uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter torrents, and
      overshadowed by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The spring rains,
      however, cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which for a few
      weeks furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that
      Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal area,
      isolated by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is admirably
      suited to become the seat of a separate independent state. In the north,
      we have the country of the two rivers&mdash;the Naharaim&mdash;extending
      from the Orontes to the Euphrates and the Balikh, or even as far as the
      Khabur:* in the centre, between the two ranges of the Lebanon, lie
      Coele-Syria and its two unequal neighbours, Aram of Damascus and
      Phoenicia; while to the south is the varied collection of provinces
      bordering the valley of the Jordan.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Naharaim of the Egyptians was first identified with
     Mesopotamia; it was located between the Orontes and the
     Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero. This opinion is now
     adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight
     differences in detail. Ed. Meyer has accurately compared the
     Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration
     of the Seleucidæ.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is impossible at the present day to assert, with any approach to
      accuracy, what peoples inhabited these different regions towards the
      fourth millennium before our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics
      are brought to light of a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we find
      stone weapons and implements, besides pottery, often elegant in contour,
      but for the most part coarse in texture and execution. These remains,
      however, are not accompanied by any monument of definite characteristics,
      and they yield no information with regard to the origin or affinities of
      the tribes who fashioned them.* The study of the geographical nomenclature
      in use about the XVIth century B.C. reveals the existence, at all events
      at that period, of several peoples and several languages. The mountains,
      rivers, towns, and fortresses in Palestine and Coele-Syria are designated
      by words of Semitic origin: it is easy to detect, even in the hieroglyphic
      disguise which they bear on the Egyptian geographical lists, names
      familiar to us in Hebrew or Assyrian.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Researches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of
     Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to
     any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias,
     near Tripoli, and by Botta at Nahr el-Kelb, and at Adlun by
     the Duc de Luynes, have been successively explored by
     Lartet, Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson. The grottoes of
     Palestine proper, at Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at
     Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since
     their discovery. The Abbé Richard desired to identify the
     flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by
     Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the
     passage of the Jordan (<i>Josh.</i> v- 2-9), some of which might
     have been buried in that hero&rsquo;s tomb.
</pre>
    <p>
      But once across the Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal
      no affinities to these languages, but are apparently connected with one or
      other of the dialects of Asia Minor.* The tenacity with which the
      place-names, once given, cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a
      certain number at least of those we know in Syria were in use there long
      before they were noted down by the Egyptians, and that they must have been
      heirlooms from very early peoples. As they take a Semitic or non-Semitic
      form according to their geographical position, we may conclude that the
      centre and south were colonized by Semites, and the north by the immigrant
      tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not wanting to support this
      conclusion, and they prove that it is not so entirely arbitrary as we
      might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic visitors who, under a king of
      the XIIth dynasty, came to offer gifts to Khnûmhotpû, the Lord of
      Beni-Hasan, are completely Semitic in type, and closely resemble the
      Bedouins of the present day. Their chief&mdash;Abisha&mdash;bears a
      Semitic name,** as too does the Sheikh Ammianshi, with whom Sinûhit took
      refuge.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns
     in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is
     admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the
     question.

     ** His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew
     Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24; xxi. 17) and
     with the Chaldæo-Assyrian Abeshukh.

     *** The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana,
     Ammiza-dugga, and perhaps Ammurabi, or Khammurabi, of one of
     the Babylonian dynasties; it contains, with the element
     Ammi, a final <i>anshi</i>. Chabas connects it with two Hebrew
     words <i>Am-nesh</i>, which he does not translate.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ammianshi himself reigned over the province of Kadimâ, a word which in
      Semitic denotes the East. Finally, the only one of their gods known to us,
      Hadad, was a Semite deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and whom we
      find later on ruling over the destinies of Damascus. Peoples of Semitic
      speech and religion must, indeed, have already occupied the greater part
      of that region on the shores of the Mediterranean which we find still in
      their possession many centuries later, at the time of the Egyptian
      conquest.

      For a time Egypt preferred not to meddle in their affairs. When, however,
      the &ldquo;lords of the sands&rdquo; grew too insolent, the Pharaoh sent a column of
      light troops against them, and inflicted on them such a severe punishment,
      that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for years. Offenders
      banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent kinglets, who were in
      a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and the Dead Sea. Egyptian
      sailors used to set out to traffic along the seaboard, taking to piracy
      when hard pressed; Egyptian merchants were accustomed to penetrate by easy
      stages into the interior. The accounts they gave of their journeys were
      not reassuring. The traveller had first to face the solitudes which
      confronted him before reaching the Isthmus, and then to avoid as best he
      might the attacks of the pillaging tribes who inhabited it.

      The notion that Syria was a sort of preserve for both big and small game

      himself there for the chase, as a prelude to meeting with the princess
      whom he was destined to marry,* or, as in the case of Kazarâti, chief of

      frontiers of Egypt came under her subtle charm and felt the power of her
      attraction, but this slight influence never penetrated beyond the
      provinces lying nearest to the Dead Sea. The remaining populations looked
      rather to Chaldæa, and received, though at a distance, the continuous
      impress of the kingdoms of the Euphrates. The tradition which attributes
      to Sargon of Agadê, and to his son Istaramsin, the subjection of the
      people of the Amanos and the Orontes, probably contains but a slight
      element of truth; but if, while awaiting further information, we hesitate
      to believe that the armies of these princes ever crossed the Lebanon or
      landed in Cyprus, we must yet admit the very early advent of their
      civilization in those western countries which are regarded as having been
      under their rule. More than three thousand years before our era, the
      Asiatics who figure on the tomb of Khnûmhotpû clothed themselves according
      to the fashions of Uru and Lagash, and affected long robes of striped and
      spotted stuffs. We may well ask if they had also borrowed the cuneiform
      syllabary for the purposes of their official correspondence,* and if the
      professional scribe with his stylus and clay tablet was to be found in
      their cities. The Babylonian courtiers were, no doubt, more familiar
      visitors among them than the Memphite nobles, while the Babylonian kings
      sent regularly to Syria for statuary stone, precious metals, and the
      timber required in the building of their monuments: Urbau and Gudea, as
      well as their successors and contemporaries, received large convoys of
      materials from the Amanos, and if the forests of Lebanon were more rarely
      utilised, it was not because their existence was unknown, but because
      distance rendered their approach more difficult and transport more costly.
      The Mediterranean marches were, in their language, classed as a whole
      under one denomination&mdash;Martu, Amurru,** the West&mdash;but there
      were distinctive names for each of the provinces into which they were
      divided.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The most ancient cuneiform tablets of Syrian origin are
     not older than the XVIth century before our era; they
     contain the official, correspondence of the native princes
     with the Pharaohs Amenôthes III. and IV. of the XVIIIth
     dynasty, as will be seen later on in this volume; they were
     discovered in the ruins of one of the palaces at Tel el-
     Amarna in Egypt.

     ** Formerly read Akharru. Martu would be the Sumerian and
     Akharru the Semitic form, Akharru meaning <i>that which is
     behind</i>. The discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets threw
     doubt on the reading of the name Akharru: some thought that
     it ought to be kept in any case; others, with more or less
     certainty, think that it should be replaced by Amuru,
     Amurru, the country of the Amorites. But the question has
     now been settled by Babylonian contract and law tablets of
     the period of Khaminurabi, in which the name is written <i>A-
     mu-ur-ri (ki)</i>. Hommel originated the idea that Martu might
     be an abbreviation of Amartu, that is, Amar with the
     feminine termination of nouns in the Canaanitish dialect:
     Martu would thus actually signify <i>the country of the
     Amorites</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Probably even at that date they called the north Khati,* and Cole-Syria,
      Amurru, the land of the Amorites. The scattered references in their
      writings seem to indicate frequent intercourse with these countries, and
      that, too, as a matter of course which excited no surprise among their
      contemporaries: a journey from Lagash to the mountains of Tidanum and to
      Gubin, or to the Lebanon and beyond it to Byblos,** meant to them no
      voyage of discovery. Armies undoubtedly followed the routes already
      frequented by caravans and flotillas of trading boats, and the time came
      when kings desired to rule as sovereigns over nations with whom their
      subjects had peaceably traded.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name of the Khati, Khatti, is found in the <i>Book of
     Omens</i>, which is supposed to contain an extract from the
     annals of Sargon and Naramsin; as, however, the text which
     we possess of it is merely a copy of the time of
     Assurbanipal, it is possible that the word Khati is merely
     the translation of a more ancient term, perhaps Martu.
     Winckler thinks it to be included in Lesser Armenia and the
     Melitônê of classical authors.

     ** Gubin is probably the Kûpûna, Kûpnû, of the Egyptians,
     the Byblos of Phoenicia. Amiaud had proposed a most unlikely
     identification with Koptos in Egypt. In the time of Inê-Sin,
     King of Ur, mention is found of Simurru, Zimyra.
</pre>
    <p>
      It does not appear, however, that the ancient rulers of Lagash ever
      extended their dominion so far. The governors of the northern cities, on
      the other hand, showed themselves more energetic, and inaugurated that
      march westwards which sooner or later brought the peoples of the Euphrates
      into collision with the dwellers on the Nile: for the first Babylonian
      empire without doubt comprised part if not the whole of Syria.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is only since the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna
     tablets that the fact of the dominant influence of Chaldæa
     over Syria and of its conquest has been definitely realized.
     It is now clear that the state of things of which the
     tablets discovered in Egypt give us a picture, could only be
     explained by the hypothesis of a Babylonish supremacy of
     long duration over the peoples situated between the
     Euphrates and the Mediterranean.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among the most celebrated names in ancient history, that of Babylon is
      perhaps the only one which still suggests to our minds a sense of vague
      magnificence and undefined dominion. Cities in other parts of the world,
      it is true, have rivalled Babylon in magnificence and power: Egypt could
      boast of more than one such city, and their ruins to this day present to
      our gaze more monuments worthy of admiration than Babylon ever contained
      in the days of her greatest prosperity. The pyramids of Memphis and the
      colossal statues of Thebes still stand erect, while the ziggurâts and the
      palaces of Chaldæa are but mounds of clay crumbling into the plain; but
      the Egyptian monuments are visible and tangible objects; we can calculate
      to within a few inches the area they cover and the elevation of their
      summits, and the very precision with which we can gauge their enormous
      size tends to limit and lessen their effect upon us. How is it possible to
      give free rein to the imagination when the subject of it is strictly
      limited by exact and determined measurements? At Babylon, on the contrary,
      there is nothing remaining to check the flight of fancy: a single hillock,
      scoured by the rains of centuries, marks the spot where the temple of Bel
      stood erect in its splendour; another represents the hanging gardens,
      while the ridges running to the right and left were once the ramparts.

    <p>
      Palaces and temples would take a shape in his imagination on a plan which
      never entered the architect&rsquo;s mind; the sacred towers as they rose would
      be disposed in more numerous stages than they actually possessed; the
      enclosing walls would reach such an elevation that they must have quickly
      fallen under their own weight if they had ever been carried so high: the
      whole restoration, accomplished without any certain data, embodies the
      concept of something vast and superhuman, well befitting the city of blood
      and tears, cursed by the Hebrew prophets. Babylon was, however, at the
      outset, but a poor town, situated on both banks of the Euphrates, in a
      low-lying, flat district, intersected by canals and liable at times to
      become marshy. The river at this point runs almost directly north and
      south, between two banks of black mud, the base of which it is perpetually
      undermining. As long as the city existed, the vertical thrust of the
      public buildings and houses kept the river within bounds, and even since
      it was finally abandoned, the masses of <i>debris</i> have almost
      everywhere had the effect of resisting its encroachment; towards the
      north, however, the line of its ancient quays has given way and sunk
      beneath the waters, while the stream, turning its course westwards, has
      transferred to the eastern bank the gardens and mounds originally on the
      opposite side. E-sagilla, the temple of the lofty summit, the sanctuary of
      Merodach, probably occupied the vacant space in the depression between the
      Babil and the hill of the Kasr.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The temple of Merodach, called by the Greeks the temple of
     Belos, has been placed on the site called Babîl by the two
     Rawlinsons; and by Oppert; Hormuzd Rassam and Fr. Delitzsch
     locate it between the hill of Junjuma and the Kasr, and
     considers Babîl to be a palace of Nebuchadrezzar.
</pre>
    <p>
      In early times it must have presented much the same appearance as the
      sanctuaries of Central Chaldæa: a mound of crude brick formed the
      substructure of the dwellings of the priests and the household of the god,
      of the shops for the offerings and for provisions, of the treasury, and of
      the apartments for purification or for sacrifice, while the whole was
      surmounted by a ziggurât. On other neighbouring platforms rose the royal
      palace and the temples of lesser divinities,* elevated above the crowd of
      private habitations.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * As, for instance, the temple E-temenanki on the actual
     hill of Amrân-ibn-Ali, the temple of Shamash, and others,

     with the second Chaldæan empire.

      The houses of the people were closely built around these stately piles, on
      either side of narrow lanes. A massive wall surrounded the whole, shutting
      out the view on all sides; it even ran along the bank of the Euphrates,
      for fear of a surprise from that quarter, and excluded the inhabitants
      from the sight of their own river. On the right bank rose a suburb, which
      was promptly fortified and enlarged, so as to become a second Babylon,
      almost equalling the first in extent and population.

      Beyond this, on the outskirts, extended gardens and fields, finding at
      length their limit at the territorial boundaries of two other towns, Kutha
      and Borsippa, whose black outlines are visible to the east and south-west
      respectively, standing isolated above the plain. Sippara on the north,
      Nippur on the south, and the mysterious Agadê, completed the circle of
      sovereign states which so closely hemmed in the city of Bel. We may
      surmise with all probability that the history of Babylon in early times
      resembled in the main that of the Egyptian Thebes. It was a small
      seigneury in the hands of petty princes ceaselessly at war with petty
      neighbours: bloody struggles, with alternating successes and reverses,
      were carried on for centuries with no decisive results, until the day came
      when some more energetic or fortunate dynasty at length crushed its
      rivals, and united under one rule first all the kingdoms of Northern and
      finally those of Southern Chaldæa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lords of Babylon had, ordinarily, a twofold function, religious and
      military, the priest at first taking precedence of the soldier, but
      gradually yielding to the latter as the town increased in power. They were
      merely the priestly representatives or administrators of Babel&mdash;<i>shakannaku
      Babili</i>&mdash;and their authority was not considered legitimate until
      officially confirmed by the god. Each ruler was obliged to go in state to
      the temple of Bel Merodach within a year of his accession: there he had to
      take the hands of the divine statue, just as a vassal would do homage to
      his liege, and those only of the native sovereigns or the foreign
      conquerors could legally call themselves Kings of Babylon&mdash;<i>sharru
      Babili</i>&mdash;who had not only performed this rite, but renewed it
      annually.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The meaning of the ceremony in which the kings of Babylon
     &ldquo;took the hands of Bel&rdquo; has been given by Winckler; Tiele
     compares it very aptly with the rite performed by the
     Egyptian kings&mdash;at Heliopolis, for example, when they
     entered alone the sanctuary of Râ, and there contemplated
     the god face to face. The rite was probably repeated
     annually, at the time of the Zakmuku, that is, the New Year
     festival.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sargon the Elder had lived in Babylon, and had built himself a palace
      there: hence the tradition of later times attributed to this city the
      glory of having been the capital of the great empire founded by the
      Akkadian dynasties. The actual sway of Babylon, though arrested to the
      south by the petty states of Lower Chaldæa, had not encountered to the
      north or north-west any enemy to menace seriously its progress in that
      semi-fabulous period of its history. The vast plain extending between the
      Euphrates and the Tigris is as it were a continuation of the Arabian
      desert, and is composed of a grey, or in parts a whitish, soil impregnated
      with selenite and common salt, and irregularly superimposed upon a bed of
      gypsum, from which asphalt oozes up here and there, forming slimy pits.
      Frost is of rare occurrence in winter, and rain is infrequent at any
      season; the sun soon burns up the scanty herbage which the spring showers
      have encouraged, but fleshy plants successfully resist its heat, such as
      the common salsola, the salsola soda, the pallasia, a small mimosa, and a
      species of very fragrant wormwood, forming together a vari-coloured
      vegetation which gives shelter to the ostrich and the wild ass, and
      affords the flocks of the nomads a grateful pasturage when the autumn has
      set in. The Euphrates bounds these solitudes, but without watering them.
      The river flows, as far as the eye can see, between two ranges of rock or
      bare hills, at the foot of which a narrow strip of alluvial soil supports
      rows of date-palms intermingled here and there with poplars, sumachs, and
      willows. Wherever there is a break in the two cliffs, or where they recede
      from the river, a series of shadufs takes possession of the bank, and
      every inch of the soil is brought under cultivation. The aspect of the
      country remains unchanged as far as the embouchure of the Khabur; but
      there a black alluvial soil replaces the saliferous clay, and if only the
      water were to remain on the land in sufficient quantity, the country would
      be unrivalled in the world for the abundance and variety of its crops.

      The fields, which are regularly sown in the neighbourhood of the small
      towns, yield magnificent harvests of wheat and barley: while in the
      prairie-land beyond the cultivated ground the grass grows so high that it
      comes up to the horses&rsquo; girths. In some places the meadows are so covered
      with varieties of flowers, growing in dense masses, that the effect
      produced is that of a variegated carpet; dogs sent in among them in search
      of game, emerge covered with red, blue, and yellow pollen. This fragrant
      prairie-land is the delight of bees, which produce excellent and abundant
      honey, while the vine and olive find there a congenial soil. The
      population was unequally distributed in this region. Some half-savage
      tribes were accustomed to wander over the plain, dwelling in tents, and
      supporting life by the chase and by the rearing of cattle; but the bulk of
      the inhabitants were concentrated around the affluents of the Euphrates
      and Tigris, or at the foot of the northern mountains wherever springs
      could be found, as in Assur, Singar, Nisibis, Tilli,* Kharranu, and in all
      the small fortified towns and nameless townlets whose ruins are scattered
      over the tract of country between the Khabur and the Balikh. Kharranu, or
      Harran, stood, like an advance guard of Chaldæan civilization, near the
      frontiers of Syria and Asia Minor.** To the north it commanded the passes
      which opened on to the basins of the Upper Euphrates and Tigris; it
      protected the roads leading to the east and south-east in the direction of
      the table-land of Iran and the Persian Gulf, and it was the key to the
      route by which the commerce of Babylon reached the countries lying around
      the Mediterranean. We have no means of knowing what affinities as regards
      origin or race connected it with Uru, but the same moon-god presided over
      the destinies of both towns, and the Sin of Harran enjoyed in very early
      times a renown nearly equal to that of his namesake.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Tilli, the only one of these towns mentioned with any
     certainty in the inscriptions of the first Chaldæan empire,
     is the Tela of classical authors, and probably the present
     Werânshaher, near the sources of the Balikh.

     ** Kharranu was identified by the earlier Assyriologists
     with the Harran of the Hebrews (<i>Gen.</i> v. 12), the Carrhse
     of classical authors, and this identification is still
     generally accepted.

      He was worshipped under the symbol of a conical stone, probably an
      aerolite, surmounted by a gilded crescent, and the ground-plan of the town
      roughly described a crescent-shaped curve in honour of its patron. His
      cult, even down to late times, was connected with cruel practices;
      generations after the advent to power of the Abbasside caliphs, his
      faithful worshippers continued to sacrifice to him human victims, whose
      heads, prepared according to the ancient rite, were accustomed to give
      oracular responses.* The government of the surrounding country was in the
      hands of princes who were merely vicegerents:** Chaldæan civilization
      before the beginnings of history had more or less laid hold of them, and
      made them willing subjects to the kings of Babylon.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Without seeking to specify exactly which were the
     doctrines introduced into Harranian religion subsequently to
     the Christian era, we may yet affirm that the base of this
     system of faith was merely a very distorted form of the
     ancient Chaldæan worship practised in the town.

     ** Only one vicegerent of Mesopotamia is known at present,
     and he belongs to the Assyrian epoch. His seal is preserved
     in the British Museum.

     *** The importance of Harran in the development of the
     history of the first Chaldæan empire was pointed out by
     Winckler; but the theory according to which this town was
     the capital of the kingdom, called by the Chaldæan and
     Assyrian scribes &ldquo;the kingdom of the world,&rdquo; is justly
     combated by Tiele.

      These sovereigns were probably at the outset somewhat obscure personages,
      without much prestige, being sometimes independent and sometimes subject
      to the rulers of neighbouring states, among others to those of Agadê. In
      later times, when Babylon had attained to universal power, and it was
      desired to furnish her kings with a continuous history, the names of these
      earlier rulers were sought out, and added to those of such foreign princes
      as had from time to time enjoyed the sovereignty over them&mdash;thus
      forming an interminable list which for materials and authenticity would
      well compare with that of the Thinite Pharaohs. This list has come down to
      us incomplete, and its remains do not permit of our determining the exact
      order of reigns, or the status of the individuals who composed it. We find
      in it, in the period immediately subsequent to the Deluge, mention of
      mythical heroes, followed by names which are still semi-legendary, such as
      Sargon the Elder; the princes of the series were, however, for the most
      part real beings, whose memories had been preserved by tradition, or whose
      monuments were still existing in certain localities. Towards the end of
      the XXVth century before our era, however, a dynasty rose into power of
      which all the members come within the range of history.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This dynasty, which is known to us in its entirety by the
     two lists of G. Smith and by Pinches, was legitimately
     composed of only eleven kings, and was known as the
     Babylonian dynasty, although Sayce suspects it to be of
     Arabian origin. It is composed as follows:&mdash;

      The dates of this dynasty are not fixed with entire certainty. The first
      of them, Sumuabîm, has left us some contracts bearing the dates of one or
      other of the fifteen years of his reign, and documents of public or
      private interest abound in proportion as we follow down the line of his
      successors. Sumulaîlu, who reigned after him, was only distantly related
      to his predecessor; but from Sumulaîlu to Sam-shusatana the kingly power
      was transmitted from father to son without a break for nine generations,
      if we may credit the testimony of the official lists.*

     * Simulaîlu, also written Samu-la-ilu, whom Mr. Pinches has
     found in a contract tablet associated with Pungunila as
     king, was not the son of Sumuabîm, since the lists do not
     mention him as such; he must, however, have been connected
     with some sort of relationship, or by marriage, with his
     predecessor, since both are placed in the same dynasty. A
     few contracts of Sumulaîlu are given by Meissner. Samsuiluna
     calls him &ldquo;my forefather (d-gula-mu), the fifth king before
     me.&rdquo;

     Hommel believes that the order of the dynasties has been
     reversed, and that the first upon the lists we possess was
     historically the second; he thus places the Babylonian
     dynasty between 2035 and 1731 B.C. His opinion has not been
     generally adopted, but every Assyriologist dealing with this
     period proposes a different date for the reigns in this
     dynasty; to take only one characteristic example, Khammurabi
     is placed by Oppert in the year 2394-2339, by Delitzsch-
     Murdter in 2287-2232, by Winckler in 2264-2210, and by
     Peiser in 2139-2084, and by Carl Niebuhr in 2081-2026.

      Contemporary records, however, prove that the course of affairs did not
      always run so smoothly. They betray the existence of at least one usurper&mdash;Immêru&mdash;who,
      even if he did not assume the royal titles, enjoyed the supreme power for
      several years between the reigns of Zabu and Abilsin. The lives of these
      rulers closely resembled those of their contemporaries of Southern
      Chaldæa. They dredged the ancient canals, or constructed new ones; they
      restored the walls of their fortresses, or built fresh strongholds on the
      frontier;* they religiously kept the festivals of the divinities belonging
      to their terrestrial domain, to whom they annually rendered solemn homage.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sumulaîlu had built six such large strongholds of brick,
     which were repaired by Samsuiluna five generations later. A
     contract of Sinmuballit is dated the year in which he built
     the great wall of a strong place, the name of which is
     unfortunately illegible on the fragment which we possess.
</pre>
    <p>
      They repaired the temples as a matter of course, and enriched them
      according to their means; we even know that Zabu, the third in order of
      the line of sovereigns, occupied himself in building the sanctuary Eulbar
      of Anunit, in Sippara. There is evidence that they possessed the small
      neighbouring kingdoms of Kishu, Sippara, and Kuta, and that they had
      consolidated them into a single state, of which Babylon was the capital.
      To the south their possessions touched upon those of the kings of Uru, but
      the frontier was constantly shifting, so that at one time an important
      city such as Nippur belonged to them, while at another it fell under the
      dominion of the southern provinces. Perpetual war was waged in the narrow
      borderland which separated the two rival states, resulting apparently in
      the balance of power being kept tolerably equal between them under the
      immediate successors of Sumuabîm* &mdash;the obscure Sumulaîlu, Zabum, the
      usurper Immeru, Abîlsin and Sinmuballit&mdash;until the reign of
      Khammurabi (the son of Sinmuballit), who finally made it incline to his
      side.** The struggle in which he was engaged, and which, after many
      vicissitudes, he brought to a successful issue, was the more decisive,
      since he had to contend against a skilful and energetic adversary who had
      considerable forces at his disposal. Birnsin*** was, in reality, of
      Elamite race, and as he held the province of Yamutbal in appanage, he was
      enabled to muster, in addition to his Chaldæan battalions, the army of
      foreigners who had conquered the maritime regions at the mouth of the
      Tigris and the Euphrates.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * None of these facts are as yet historically proved: we
     may, however, conjecture with some probability what was the
     general state of things, when we remember that the first
     kings of Babylon were contemporaries of the last independent
     sovereigns of Southern Chaldæa.

     ** The name of this prince has been read in several ways&mdash;
     Hammurabi, Khammurabi, by the earlier Assyriologists,
     subsequently Hammuragash, Khammuragash, as being of Elamite
     or Cossoan extraction: the reading Khammurabi is at present
     the prevailing one. The bilingual list published by Pinches
     makes Khammurabi an equivalent of the Semitic names Kimta-
     rapashtum. Hence Halévy concluded that Khammurabi was a
     series of ideograms, and that Kimtarapashtum was the true
     reading of the name; his proposal, partially admitted by
     Hommel, furnishes us with a mixed reading of Khammurapaltu,
     Amraphel. [Hommel is now convinced of the identity of the
     Amraphel of <i>Gen.</i> xiv. I with Khammurabi.&mdash;Te.] Sayce,
     moreover, adopts the reading Khammurabi, and assigns to him
     an Arabian origin. The part played by this prince was
     pointed out at an early date by Menant. Recent discoveries
     have shown the important share which he had in developing
     the Chaldæan empire, and have, increased his reputation with
     Assyriologists.

     *** The name of this king has been the theme of heated
     discussions: it was at first pronounced Aradsin, Ardusin, or
     Zikarsin; it is now read in several different ways&mdash;Rimsin,
     or Eriaku, Riaku, Rimagu. Others have made a distinction
     between the two forms, and have made out of them the names
     of two different kings. They are all variants of the same
     name. I have adopted the form Rimsin, which is preferred by
     a few Assyriologists. [The tablets recently discovered by
     Mr. Pinches, referring to Kudur-lagamar and Tudkhula, which
     he has published in a Paper road before the Victoria
     Institute, Jan. 20, 1896, have shown that the true reading
     is Eri-Aku. The Elamite name Eri-Aku, &ldquo;servant of the moon-
     god,&rdquo; was changed by some of his subjects into the
     Babylonian Rim-Sin, &ldquo;Have mercy, O Moon-god!&rdquo; just as
     Abêsukh, the Hebrew Absihu&rsquo;a (&ldquo;the father of welfare&rdquo;) was
     transformed into the Babylonian Ebisum (&ldquo;the actor&rdquo;).&mdash;Ed.]

      It was not the first time that Elam had audaciously interfered in the
      affairs of her neighbours. In fabulous times, one of her mythical kings&mdash;Khumbaba
      the Ferocious&mdash;had oppressed. Uruk, and Gilgames with all his valour
      was barely able to deliver the town. Sargon the Elder is credited with
      having subdued Elam; the kings and vicegerents of Lagash, as well as those
      of Uru and. Larsam, had measured forces with Anshan, but with no decisive
      issue. From time to time they obtained an advantage, and we find recorded
      in the annals victories gained by Gudea, Inê-sin, or Bursin, but to be
      followed only by fresh reverses; at the close of such campaigns, and in
      order to seal the ensuing peace, à princess of Susa would be sent as a
      bride to one of the Chaldæan cities, or a Chaldæan lady of royal birth
      would enter the harem of a king of Anshân. Elam was protected along the
      course of the Tigris and on the shores of the Nâr-Marratum by a wide
      marshy region, impassable except at a few fixed and easily defended
      places. The alluvial plain extending behind the marshes was as rich and
      fertile as that of Chaldæa. Wheat and barley ordinarily yielded an hundred
      and at times two hundredfold; the towns were surrounded by a shadeless
      belt of palms; the almond, fig, acacia, poplar, and willow extended in
      narrow belts along the rivers&rsquo; edge. The climate closely resembles that of
      Chaldaja: if the midday heat in summer is more pitiless, it is at least
      tempered by more frequent east winds. The ground, however, soon begins to
      rise, ascending gradually towards the north-east. The distant and uniform
      line of mountain-peaks grows loftier on the approach of the traveller, and
      the hills begin to appear one behind another, clothed halfway up with
      thick forests, but bare on their summits, or scantily covered with meagre
      vegetation. They comprise, in fact, six or seven parallel ranges,
      resembling natural ramparts piled up between the country of the Tigris and
      the table-land of Iran. The intervening valleys were formerly lakes,
      having had for the most part no communication with each other and no
      outlet into the sea. In the course of centuries they had dried up, leaving
      a thick deposit of mud in the hollows of their ancient beds, from which
      sprang luxurious and abundant harvests. The rivers&mdash;the Uknu,* the
      Ididi,** and the Ulaî***&mdash;which water this region are, on reaching
      more level ground, connected by canals, and are constantly shifting their
      beds in the light soil of the Susian plain: they soon attain a width equal
      to that of the Euphrates, but after a short time lose half their volume in
      swamps, and empty themselves at the present day into the Shatt-el-Arab.
      They flowed formerly into that part of the Persian Gulf which extended as
      far as Kornah, and the sea thus formed the southern frontier of the
      kingdom.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Uknu is the Kerkhah of the present day, the Choaspes
     of the Greeks.

     ** The Ididi was at first identified with the ancient
     Pasitigris, which scholars then desired to distinguish from
     the Eulseos: it is now known to be the arm of the Karun
     which runs to Dizful, the Koprates of classical times, which
     has sometimes been confounded with the Eulaws.

     *** The Ulaî, mentioned in the Hebrew texts (Ban. viii. 2,
     16), the Euloos of classical writers, also called
     Pasitigris. It is the Karun of the present day, until its
     confluence with the Shaûr, and subsequently the Shaûr
     itself, which waters the foot of the Susian hills.

      From earliest times this country was inhabited by three distinct peoples,
      whose descendants may still be distinguished at the present day, and
      although they have dwindled in numbers and become mixed with elements of
      more recent origin, the resemblance to their forefathers is still very
      remarkable. There were, in the first place, the short and robust people of
      well-knit figure, with brown skins, black hair and eyes, who belonged to
      that negritic race which inhabited a considerable part of Asia in
      prehistoric times.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The connection of the negroid type of Susians with the
     negritic races of India and Oceania, has been proved, in the
     course of M. Dieulafoy&rsquo;s expedition to the Susian plains and
     the ancient provinces of Elam.

      These prevailed in the lowlands and the valleys, where the warm, damp
      climate favoured their development; but they also spread into the mountain
      region, and had pushed their outposts as far as the first slopes of the
      Iranian table-land. They there contact with white-skinned of medium
      height, who were probably allied to the nations of Northern and Central
      Asia&mdash;to the Scythians,* for instance, if it is permissible to use a
      vague term employed by the Ancients.

     employ horses and chariots in warfare.

      Semites of the same stock as those of Chaldæa pushed forward as far as the
      east bank of the Tigris, and settling mainly among the marshes led a
      precarious life by fishing and pillaging.* The country of the plain was
      called Anzân, or Anshân,** and the mountain region Numma, or Ilamma, &ldquo;the
      high lands:&rdquo; these two names were subsequently used to denote the whole
      country, and Ilamma has survived in the Hebrew word Elam.*** Susa, the
      most important and flourishing town in the kingdom, was situated between
      the Ulaî and the Ididi, some twenty-five or thirty miles from the nearest
      of the mountain ranges.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * From the earliest times we meet beyond the Tigris with
     names like that of Durilu, a fact which proves the existence
     of races speaking a Semitic dialect in the countries under
     the suzerainty of the King of Elam: in the last days of the
     Chaldæan empire they had assumed such importance that the
     Hebrews made out Elam to be one of the sons of Shem (<i>Gen.</i>
     x. 22).

     ** Anzân, Anshân, and, by assimilation of the nasal with the
     sibilant, Ashshân. This name has already been mentioned in
     the inscriptions of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash and
     in the <i>Book of Prophecies</i> of the ancient Chaldæan
     astronomers; it also occurs in the royal preamble of Cyrus
     and his ancestors, who like him were styled &ldquo;kings of
     Anshân.&rdquo; It had been applied to the whole country of Elam,
     and afterwards to Persia. Some are of opinion that it was
     the name of a part of Elam, viz. that inhabited by the
     Turanian Medes who spoke the second language of the
     Achæmenian inscriptions, the eastern half, bounded by the
     Tigris and the Persian Gulf, consisting of a flat and swampy
     land. These differences of opinion gave rise to a heated
     controversy; it is now, however, pretty generally admitted
     that Anzân-Anshân was really the plain of Elam, from the
     mountains to the sea, and one set of authorities affirms
     that the word Anzân may have meant &ldquo;plain&rdquo; in the language
     of the country, while others hesitate as yet to pronounce
     definitely on this point.

     *** The meaning of &ldquo;Nunima,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ilamma,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ilamtu,&rdquo; in the
     group of words used to indicate Elam, had been recognised
     even by the earliest Assyriologists; the name originally
     referred to the hilly country on the north and east of Susa.
     To the Hebrews, Elam was one of the sons of Shem (Gen. x.
     22). The Greek form of the name is Elymais, and some of the
     classical geographers were well enough acquainted with the
     meaning of the word to be able to distinguish the region to
     which it referred from Susiana proper.

     ** Strabo tells us, on the authority of Polycletus, that the
     town had no walls in the time of Alexander, and extended
     over a space two hundred stadia in length; in the
     VIII century B.C. it was enclosed by walls with bastions,

      Further up the course of the Uknu, lay the following cities: Madaktu, the

      Naditu,** Til-Khumba,*** Dur-Undash,**** Khaidalu.^&mdash;all large walled
      towns, most of which assumed the title of royal cities. Elam in reality
      constituted a kind of feudal empire, composed of several tribes&mdash;the
      Habardip, the Khushshi, the Umliyash, the people of Yamutbal and of
      Yatbur^^&mdash;all independent of each other, but often united under the
      authority of one sovereign, who as a rule chose Susa as the seat of
      government.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Madaktu, Mataktu, the Badaka of Diodorus, situated on the

     Rawlinson near the bifurcation of the Kerkhah, either at
     Paipul or near Aiwân-i-Kherkah, where there are some rather
     important and ancient ruins; Billerbeck prefers to put it at
     the mouth of the valley of Zal-fer, on the site at present
     occupied by the citadel of Kala-i-Riza.

     ** Naditu is identified by Finzi with the village of
     Natanzah, near Ispahan; it ought rather to be looked for in
     the neighbourhood of Sarna.

     *** Til-Khumba, the Mound of Khumba, so named after one of
     the principal Elamite gods, was, perhaps, situated among the
     ruins of Budbar, towards the confluence of the Ab-i-Kirind
     and Kerkhah, or possibly higher up in the mountain, in the
     vicinity of Asmanabad.

     **** Dur-Undash, Dur-Undasi, has been identified, without
     absolutely conclusive reason, with the fortress of Kala-i-
     Dis on the Disful-Rud.

     ^ Khaidalu, Khidalu, is perhaps the present fortress of Dis-
     Malkan.

     ^^ The countries of Yatbur and Yamutbal extended into the
     plain between the marshes of the Tigris and the mountain;
     the town of Durilu was near the Yamutbal region, if not in
     that country itself. Umliyash lay between the Uknu and the

      The language is not represented by any idioms now spoken, and its

      establish, are too uncertain to make it safe to base any theory upon
      them.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A great part of the Susian inscriptions have been
     collected by Fr. Lenormant. An attempt has been made to
     identify the language in which they are written with the
     Sumero-accadian, and authorities now generally agree in
     considering the Arcæmenian inscriptions of the second type
     as representative of its modern form. Hommel connects it
     with Georgian, and includes it in a great linguistic family,
     which comprises, besides these two idioms, the Hittite, the
     Cappadocian, the Armenian of the Van inscriptions, and the
     Cosstean. Oppert claims to have discovered on a tablet in
     the British Museum a list of words belonging to one of the
     idioms (probably Semitic) of Susiana, which differs alike
     from the Suso-Medic and the Assyrian.
</pre>
    <p>
      The little that we know of Elamite religion reveals to us a mysterious
      world, full of strange names and vague forms. Over their hierarchy there
      presided a deity who was called Shushinak (the Susian), Dimesh or Samesh,
      Dagbag, As-siga, Adaene, and possibly Khumba and Æmmân, whom the Chaldæns
      identified with their god Ninip; his statue was concealed in a sanctuary
      inaccessible to the profane, but it was dragged from thence by
      Assurbanipal of Nineveh in the VIIth century B.C.* This deity was
      associated with six others of the first rank, who were divided into two
      triads&mdash;Shumudu, Lagamaru, Partikira; Ammankasibar, Uduran, and
      Sapak: of these names, the least repellent, Ammankasibar, may possibly be
      the Memnon of the Greeks. The dwelling of these divinities was near Susa,
      in the depths of a sacred forest to which the priests and kings alone had
      access: their images were brought out on certain days to receive solemn
      homage, and were afterwards carried back to their shrine accompanied by a
      devout and reverent multitude. These deities received a tenth of the spoil
      after any successful campaign&mdash;the offerings comprising statues of
      the enemies&rsquo; gods, valuable vases, ingots of gold and silver, furniture,
      and stuffs. The Elamite armies were well organized, and under a skilful
      general became irresistible. In other respects the Elamites closely
      resembled the Chaldæans, pursuing the same industries and having the same
      agricultural and commercial instincts. In the absence of any bas-reliefs
      and inscriptions peculiar to this people, we may glean from the monuments
      of Lagash and Babylon a fair idea of the extent of their civilization in
      its earliest stages.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * <i>Shushinak</i> is an adjective derived from the name of the
     town of Susa. The real name of the god was probably kept
     secret and rarely uttered. The names which appear by the
     side of Shushinak in the text published by H. Rawlinson, as
     equivalents of the Babylonian Ninip, perhaps represent
     different deities; we may well ask whether the deity may not
     be the Khumba, Umma, Ummân, who recurs so frequently in the
     names of men and places, and who has hitherto never been met
     with alone in any formula or dedicatory tablet.

      The cities of the Euphrates, therefore, could have been sensible of but
      little change, when the chances of war transferred them from the rule of
      their native princes to that of an Elamite. The struggle once over, and
      the resulting evils repaired as far as practicable, the people of these
      towns resumed their usual ways, hardly conscious of the presence of their
      foreign ruler. The victors, for their part, became assimilated so rapidly
      with the vanquished, that at the close of a generation or so the
      conquering dynasty was regarded legitimate and national one, loyally
      attached to the traditions and religion of its adopted country. In the
      year 2285 B.C., towards the close of the reign of Nurrammân, or in the
      earlier part of that of Siniddinam, a King of Elam, by name
      Kudur-nakhunta, triumphantly marched through Chaldæa from end to end,
      devastating the country and sparing neither town nor temple: Uruk lost its
      statue of Nana, which was carried off as a trophy and placed in the
      sanctuary of Susa. The inhabitants long mourned the detention of their
      goddess, and a hymn of lamentation, probably composed for the occasion by
      one of their priests, kept the remembrance of the disaster fresh in their
      memories. &ldquo;Until when, oh lady, shall the impious enemy ravage the
      country!&mdash;In thy queen-city, Uruk, the destruction is accomplished,&mdash;in
      Eulbar, the temple of thy oracle, blood has flowed like water,&mdash;upon
      the whole of thy lands has he poured out flame, and it is spread abroad
      like smoke.&mdash;Oh, lady, verily it is hard for me to bend under the
      yoke of misfortune!&mdash;? Oh, lady, thou hast wrapped me about, thou
      hast plunged me, in sorrow!&mdash;The impious mighty one has broken me in
      pieces like a reèd,&mdash;and I know not what to resolve, I trust not in
      myself,&mdash;like a bed of reeds I sigh day and night!&mdash;I, thy
      servant, I bow myself before thee!&rdquo; It would appear that the whole of
      Chaldæa, including Babylon itself, was forced to acknowledge the supremacy
      of the invader;* a Susian empire thus absorbed Chaldæa, reducing its
      states to feudal provinces, and its princes to humble vassals.
      Kudur-nakhunta having departed, the people of Larsa exerted themselves to
      the utmost to repair the harm that he had done, and they succeeded but too
      well, since their very prosperity was the cause only a short time after of
      the outburst of another storm. Siniddinam, perhaps, desired to shake off
      the Elamite yoke. Simtishilkhak, one of the successors of Kudur-nakhunta,
      had conceded the principality of Yamutbal as a fief to Kudur-mabug, one of
      his sons. Kudur-mabug appears to have been a conqueror of no mean ability,
      for he claims, in his inscriptions, the possession of the whole of
      Syria.**

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The submission of Babylon is evident from the title Adda
     Martu, &ldquo;sovereign of the West,&rdquo; assumed by several of the
     Elamite princes (of. p. 65 of the present work): in order to
     extend his authority beyond the Euphrates, it was necessary
     for the King of Elam to be first of all master of Babylon.
     In the early days of Assyriology it was supposed that this
     period of Elamite supremacy coincided with the Median
     dynasty of Berosus.

     ** His preamble contains the titles <i>adda Martu,</i> &ldquo;prince of
     Syria;&rdquo; <i>adda lamutbal</i>, &ldquo;prince of Yamutbal.&rdquo; The word
     <i>adda</i> seems properly to mean &ldquo;lather,&rdquo; and the literal
     translation of the full title would probably be &ldquo;father of
     Syria,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>father</i> of Yamutbal,&rdquo; whence the secondary
     meanings &ldquo;master, lord, prince,&rdquo; which have been
     provisionally accepted by most Assyriologists. Tiele, and
     Winckler after him, have suggested that Martu is here
     equivalent to Yamutbal, and that it was merely used to
     indicate the western part of Elam; Winckler afterwards
     rejected this hypothesis, and has come round to the general
     opinion.
</pre>

      He obtained a victory over Siniddinam, and having dethroned him, placed
      the administration of the kingdom in the hands of his own son Eimsin. This
      prince, who was at first a feudatory, afterwards associated in the
      government with his father, and finally sole monarch after the latter&rsquo;s
      death, married a princess of Chaldæan blood, and by this means
      legitimatized his usurpation in the eyes of his subjects. His domain,
      which lay on both sides of the Tigris and of the Euphrates, comprised,
      besides the principality of Yamutbal, all the towns dependent on Sumer and
      Accad&mdash;Uru, Larsa, Uruk, and Nippur, He acquitted himself as a good
      sovereign in the sight of gods and men: he repaired the brickwork in the
      temple of Nannar at Uru; he embellished the temple of Shamash at Larsa,
      and caused two statues of copper to be cast in honour of the god; he also
      rebuilt Lagash and Grirsu. The city of Uruk had been left a heap of ruins
      after the withdrawal of Kudur-nakhunta: he set about the work of
      restoration, constructed a sanctuary to Papsukal, raised the ziggurât of
      Nana, and consecrated to the goddess an entire set of temple furniture to
      replace that carried off by the Elamites. He won the adhesion of the
      priests by piously augmenting their revenues, and throughout his reign
      displayed remarkable energy. Documents exist which attribute to him the
      reduction of Durilu, on the borders of Elam and the Chaldæan states;
      others contain discreet allusions to a perverse enemy who disturbed his
      peace in the north, and whom he successfully repulsed. He drove
      Sinmuballit out of Ishin, and this victory so forcibly impressed his
      contemporaries, that they made it the starting-point of a new
      semi-official era; twenty-eight years after the event, private contracts
      still continued to be dated by reference to the taking of Ishin.
      Sinmuballit&rsquo;s son, Khammurabi, was more fortunate. Eimsin vainly appealed
      for help against him to his relative and suzerain Kudur-lagamar, who had
      succeeded Simtishilkhak at Susa. Eimsin was defeated, and disappeared from
      the scene of action, leaving no trace behind him, though we may infer that
      he took refuge in his fief of Yamutbal. The conquest by Khammurabi was by
      no means achieved at one blow, the enemy offering an obstinate resistance.
      He was forced to destroy several fortresses, the inhabitants of which had
      either risen against him or had refused to do him homage, among them being
      those of Meîr* and Malgu. When the last revolt had been put down, all the
      countries speaking the language of Chaldæa and sharing its civilization
      were finally united into a single kingdom, of which Khammurabi proclaimed
      himself the head. Other princes who had preceded him had enjoyed the same
      opportunities, but their efforts had never been successful in establishing
      an empire of any duration; the various elements had been bound together
      for a moment, merely to be dispersed again after a short interval. The
      work of Khammurabi, on the contrary, was placed on a solid foundation, and
      remained unimpaired under his successors. Not only did he hold sway
      without a rival in the south as in the north, but the titles indicating
      the rights he had acquired over Sumer and Accad were inserted in his
      Protocol after those denoting his hereditary possessions,&mdash;the city
      of Bel and the four houses of the world. Khammurabi&rsquo;s victory marks the
      close of those long centuries of gradual evolution during which the
      peoples of the Lower Euphrates passed from division to unity. Before his
      reign there had been as many states as cities, and as many dynasties as
      there were states; after him there was but one kingdom under one line of
      kings.

     * Maîru, Meîr, has been identified with Shurippak; but it
     is, rather, the town of Mar, now Tell-Id. A and Lagamal, the
     Elamite Lagamar, were worshipped there. It was the seat of a
     linen manufacture, and possessed large shipping.
</pre>
    <p>
      Khammurabi&rsquo;s long reign of fifty-five years has hitherto yielded us but a
      small number of monuments&mdash;seals, heads of sceptres, alabaster vases,
      and pompous inscriptions, scarcely any of them being of historical
      interest. He was famous for the number of his campaigns, no details of
      which, however, have come to light, but the dedication of one of his
      statues celebrates his good fortune on the battlefield. &ldquo;Bel has lent thee
      sovereign majesty: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;Sin has lent thee
      royalty: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;Ninip has lent thee his supreme
      weapon: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;The goddess of light, Ishtar, has
      lent thee the shock of arms and the fray: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;Shamash
      and Bamman are thy varlets: thou, what awaitest thou?&mdash;It is
      Khammurabi, the king, the powerful chieftain&mdash;who cuts the enemies in
      pieces,&mdash;the whirlwind of battle&mdash;who overthrows the country of
      the rebels&mdash;who stays combats, who crushes rebellions,&mdash;who
      destroys the stubborn like images of clay,&mdash;who overcomes the
      obstacles of inaccessible mountains.&rdquo; The majority of these expeditions
      were, no doubt, consequent on the victory which destroyed the power of
      Kimsin. It would not have sufficed merely to drive back the Elamites
      beyond the Tigris; it was necessary to strike a blow within their own
      territory to avoid a recurrence of hostilities, which might have
      endangered the still recent work of conquest. Here, again, Khammurabi
      seems to have met with his habitual success.

      Ashnunak was a border district, and shared the fate of all the provinces
      on the eastern bank of the Tigris, being held sometimes by Elam and
      sometimes by Chaldæa; properly speaking, it was a country of Semitic
      speech, and was governed by viceroys owning allegiance, now to Babylon,
      now to Susa.* Khammurabi seized this province, and permanently secured its
      frontier by building along the river a line of fortresses surrounded by
      earthworks. Following the example of his predecessors, he set himself to
      restore and enrich the temples.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Pognon discovered inscriptions of four of the vicegerents
     of Ashnunak, which he assigns, with some hesitation, to the
     time of Khammurabi, rather than to that of the kings of
     Telloh. Three of these names are Semitic, the fourth
     Sumerian; the language of the inscriptions bears a
     resemblance to the Semitic dialect of Chaldæa.

      The house of Zamama and Ninni, at Kish, was out of repair, and the
      ziggurât threatened to fall; he pulled it down and rebuilt it, carrying it
      to such a height that its summit &ldquo;reached the heavens.&rdquo; Merodach had
      delegated to him the government of the faithful, and had raised him to the
      rank of supreme ruler over the whole of Chaldæa. At Babylon, close to the
      great lake which served as a reservoir for the overflow of the Euphrates,
      the king restored the sanctuary of Esagilla, the dimensions of which did
      not appear to him to be proportionate to the growing importance of the
      city. &ldquo;He completed this divine dwelling with great joy and delight, he
      raised the summit to the firmament,&rdquo; and then enthroned Merodach and his
      spouse, Zarpanit, within it, amid great festivities. He provided for the
      ever-recurring requirements of the national religion by frequent gifts;
      the tradition has come down to us of the granary for wheat which he built
      at Babylon, the sight of which alone rejoiced the heart of the god. While
      surrounding Sippar with a great wall and a fosse, to protect its earthly
      inhabitants, he did not forget Shamash and Malkatu, the celestial patrons
      of the town. He enlarged in their honour the mysterious Ebarra, the sacred
      seat of their worship, and that which no king from the earliest times had
      known how to build for his divine master, that did he generously for
      Shamash his master. He restored Ezida, the eternal dwelling of Merodach,
      at Borsippa; Eturka-lamma, the temple of Anu, Ninni, and Nana, the
      suzerains of Kish; and also Ezikalamma, the house of the goddess Ninna, in
      the village of Zarilab. In the southern provinces, but recently added to
      the crown,&mdash;at Larsa, Uruk, and Uru,&mdash;he displayed similar
      activity.

      He had, doubtless, a political as well as a religious motive in all he
      did; for if he succeeded in winning the allegiance of the priests by the
      prodigality of his pious gifts, he could count on their gratitude in
      securing for him the people&rsquo;s obedience, and thus prevent the outbreak of
      a revolt. He had, indeed, before him a difficult task in attempting to
      allay the ills which had been growing during centuries of civil discord
      and foreign conquest. The irrigation of the country demanded constant
      attention, and from earliest times its sovereigns had directed the work
      with real solicitude; but owing to the breaking up of the country into
      small states, their respective resources could not be combined in such
      general operations as were needed for controlling the inundations and
      effectually remedying the excess or the scarcity of water. Khammurabi
      witnessed the damage done to the whole province of Umliyash by one of
      those terrible floods which still sometimes ravage the regions of the
      Lower Tigris,* and possibly it may have been to prevent the recurrence of
      such a disaster that he undertook the work of canalization.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Contracts dated the year of an inundation which laid waste
     Umliyash; cf. in our own time, the inundation of April 10,
     1831, which in a single night destroyed half the city of
     Bagdad, and in which fifteen thousand persons lost their
     lives either by drowning or by the collapse of their houses.

      He was the first that we know of who attempted to organize and reduce to a
      single system the complicated network of ditches and channels which
      intersected the territory belonging to the great cities between Babylon
      and the sea. Already, more than half a century previously, Siniddinam had
      enlarged the canal on which Larsa was situated, while Bimsin had provided
      an outlet for the &ldquo;River of the Gods&rdquo; into the Persian Gulf:* by the
      junction of the two a navigable channel was formed between the Euphrates
      and the marshes, and an outlet was thus made for the surplus waters of the
      inundation. Khammurabi informs us how Anu and Bel, having confided to him
      the government of Sumer and Accad, and having placed in his hands the
      reins of power, he dug the Nâr-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to the
      people, which brings abundance of water to the country of Sumir and Accad.
      &ldquo;I turned both its banks into cultivated ground, I heaped up mounds of
      grain and I furnished perpetual water for the people of Sumir and Accad.
      The country of Sumer and Accad, I gathered together its nations who were
      scattered, I gave them pasture and drink, I ruled over them in riches and
      abundance, I caused them to inhabit a peaceful dwelling-place. Then it was
      that Khammurabi, the powerful king, the favourite of the great gods, I
      myself, according to the prodigious strength with which Merodach had
      endued me, I constructed a high fortress, upon mounds of earth; its summit
      rises to the height of the mountains, at the head of the Nâr-Khammurabi,
      the source of wealth to the people. This fortress I called
      Dur-Sinmuballit-abim-uâlidiya, the Fortress of Sinmuballit, the father who
      begat me, so that the name of Sinmuballit, the father who begat me, may
      endure in the habitations of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Contract dated &ldquo;the year the Tigris, river of the gods,
     was canalized down to the sea&rdquo;; i.e. as far as the point to
     which the sea then penetrated in the environs of Kornah.
</pre>
    <p>
      This canal of Khammurabi ran from a little south of Babylon, joining those
      of Siniddinam and Rimsin, and probably cutting the alluvial plain in its
      entire length.* It drained the stagnant marshes on either side along its
      course, and by its fertilising effects, the dwellers on its banks were
      enabled to reap full harvests from the lands which previously had been
      useless for purposes of cultivation. A ditch of minor importance pierced
      the isthmus which separates the Tigris and the Euphrates in the
      neighbourhood of Sippar.** Khammurabi did not rest contented with these; a
      system of secondary canals doubtless completed the whole scheme of
      irrigation which he had planned after the achievement of his conquest, and
      his successors had merely to keep up his work in order to ensure an
      unrivalled prosperity to the empire.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Delattre is of opinion that the canal dug by Khammurabi is
     the Arakhtu of later epochs which began at Babylon and
     extended as far as the Larsa canal. It must therefore be
     approximately identified with the Shatt-en-Nil of the
     present day, which joins Shatt-el-Kaher, the canal of
     Siniddinam.

     ** The canal which Khammurabi caused to be dug or dredged
     may be the Nâr-Malkâ, or &ldquo;royal canal,&rdquo; which ran from the
     Tigris to the Euphrates, passing Sippar on the way. The
     digging of this canal is mentioned in a contract.
</pre>
    <p>
      Their efforts in this direction were not unsuccessful. Samsuîluna, the son
      of Khammurabi, added to the existing system two or three fresh canals, one
      at least of which still bore his name nearly fifteen centuries later; it
      is mentioned in the documents of the second Assyrian empire in the time of
      Assurbanipal, and it is possible that traces of it may still be found at
      the present day. Abiêshukh,* Ammisatana,** Ammizadugga,*** and
      Samsusatana,**** all either continued to elaborate the network planned by
      their ancestors, or applied themselves to the better distribution of the
      overflow in those districts where cultivation was still open to
      improvement.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Abîshukh (the Hebrew Abishua) is the form of the name
     which we find in contemporary contracts. The official lists
     contain the variant Ebishu, Ebîshum.

     ** Ammiditana is only a possible reading: others prefer
     Ammisatana. The Nâr-Ammisatana is mentioned in a Sippar
     contract. Another contract is dated &ldquo;the year in which
     Ammisatana, the king, repaired the canal of Samsuîluna.&rdquo;

     *** This was, at first, read Ammididugga. Ammizadugga is
     mentioned in the date of a contract as having executed
     certain works&mdash;of what nature it is not easy to say&mdash;on the
     banks of the Tigris; another contract is dated &ldquo;the year in
     which Ammizadugga, the king, by supreme command of Sha-mash,
     his master, [dug] the Ndr-Ammizadugga-nulchus-nishi (canal
     of Ammizadugga), prosperity of men.&rdquo; In the Minæan
     inscriptions of Southern Arabia the name is found under the
     form of Ammi-Zaduq.

     **** Sometimes erroneously read Samdiusatana; but, as a
     matter of fact, we have contracts of that time, in which a
     royal name is plainly written as Samsusatana.

    <p>
      We should know nothing of these kings had not the scribes of those times
      been in the habit of dating the contracts of private individuals by
      reference to important national events. They appear to have chosen by
      preference incidents in the religious life of the country; as, for
      instance, the restoration of a temple, the annual enthronisation of one of
      the great divinities, such as Shamash, Merodach, Ishtar, or Nana, as the
      eponymous god of the current year, the celebration of a solemn festival,
      or the consecration of a statue; while a few scattered allusions to works
      of fortification show that meanwhile the defence of the country was
      jealously watched over.* These sovereigns appear to have enjoyed long
      reigns, the shortest extending over a period of five and twenty years; and
      when at length the death of any king occurred, he was immediately replaced
      by his son, the notaries&rsquo; acts and the judicial documents which have come
      down to us betraying no confusion or abnormal delay in the course of
      affairs. We may, therefore, conclude that the last century and a half of
      the dynasty was a period of peace and of material prosperity. Chaldæa was
      thus enabled to fully reap the advantage of being united under the rule of
      one individual. It is quite possible that those cities&mdash;Uru, Larsa,
      Ishin, Uruk, and Nippur&mdash;which had played so important a part in the
      preceding centuries, suffered from the loss of their prestige, and from
      the blow dealt to their traditional pretensions.

      Up to this time they had claimed the privilege of controlling the history
      of their country, and they had bravely striven among themselves for the
      supremacy over the southern states; but the revolutions which had raised
      each in turn to the zenith of power, had never exalted any one of them to
      such an eminence as to deprive its rivals of all hope of supplanting it
      and of enjoying the highest place. The rise of Babylon destroyed the last
      chance which any of them had of ever becoming the capital; the new city
      was so favourably situated, and possessed so much wealth and so many
      soldiers, while its kings displayed such tenacious energy, that its
      neighbours were forced to bow before it and resign themselves to the
      subordinate position of leading provincial towns. They gave a loyal
      obedience to the officers sent them from the north, and sank gradually
      into obscurity, the loss of their political supremacy being somewhat
      compensated for by the religious respect in which they were always held.
      Their ancient divinities&mdash;Nana, Sin, Anu, and Ra&mdash;were adopted,
      if we may use the term, by the Babylonians, who claimed the protection of
      these gods as fully as they did that of Merodach or of Nebo, and prided
      themselves on amply supplying all their needs. As the inhabitants of
      Babylon had considerable resources at their disposal, their appeal to
      these deities might be regarded as productive of more substantial results
      than the appeal of a merely local kinglet. The increase of the national
      wealth and the concentration, under one head, of armies hitherto owning
      several chiefs, enabled the rulers, not of Babylon or Larsa alone, but of
      the whole of Chaldæa, to offer an invincible resistance to foreign
      enemies, and to establish their dominion in countries where their
      ancestors had enjoyed merely a precarious sovereignty. Hostilities never
      completely ceased between Elam and Babylon; if arrested for a time, they
      broke out again in some frontier disturbance, at times speedily
      suppressed, but at others entailing violent consequences and ending in a
      regular war. No document furnishes us with any detailed account of these
      outbreaks, but it would appear that the balance of power was maintained on
      the whole with tolerable regularity, both kingdoms at the close of each
      generation finding themselves in much the same position as they had
      occupied at its commencement. The two empires were separated from south to
      north by the sea and the Tigris, the frontier leaving the river near the
      present village of Amara and running in the direction of the mountains.
      Durîlu probably fell ordinarily under Chaldæan jurisdiction. Umliyash was
      included in the original domain of Kham-murabi, and there is no reason to
      believe that it was evacuated by his descendants. There is every
      probability that they possessed the plain east of the Tigris, comprising
      Nineveh and Arbela, and that the majority of the civilized peoples
      scattered over the lower slopes of the Kurdish mountains rendered them
      homage. They kept the Mesopotamian table-land under their suzerainty, and
      we may affirm, without exaggeration, that their power extended northwards
      as far as Mount Masios, and westwards to the middle course of the
      Euphrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what period the Chaldæans first crossed that river is as yet unknown.
      Many of their rulers in their inscriptions claim the title of suzerains
      over Syria, and we have no evidence for denying their pretensions.
      Kudur-mabug proclaims himself &ldquo;adda&rdquo; of Martu, Lord of the countries of
      the West, and we are in the possession of several facts which suggest the
      idea of a great Blamite empire, with a dominion extending for some period
      over Western Asia, the existence of which was vaguely hinted at by the
      Greeks, who attributed its glory to the fabulous Memnon.* Contemporary
      records are still wanting which might show whether Kudur-mabug inherited
      these distant possessions from one of his predecessors&mdash;such as
      Kudur-nakhunta, for instance&mdash;or whether he won them himself at the
      point of the sword; but a fragment of an old chronicle, inserted in the
      Hebrew Scriptures, speaks distinctly of another Elamite, who made war in
      person almost up to the Egyptian frontier.** This is the Kudur-lagamar
      (Chedorlaomer) who helped Eimsin against Hammurabi, but was unable to
      prevent his overthrow.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We know that to Herodotus (v. 55) Susa was the city of
     Memnon, and that Strabo attributes its foundation to
     Tithonus, father of Memnon. According to Oppert, the word
     Memnon is the equivalent of the Susian Umman-anîn, &ldquo;the
     house of the king:&rdquo; Weissbach declares that &ldquo;anin&rdquo; does not
     mean king, and contradicts Oppert&rsquo;s view, though he does not
     venture to suggest a new explanation of the name.

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xiv. Prom the outset Assyriologists have never
     doubted the historical accuracy of this chapter, and they
     have connected the facts which it contains with those which
     seem to be revealed by the Assyrian monuments. The two
     Rawlinsons intercalate Kudur-lagamar between Kudur-nakhunta
     and Kudur-mabug, and Oppert places him about the same
     period. Fr. Lenormant regards him as one of the successors
     of Kudur-mabug, possibly his immediate successor. G. Smith
     does not hesitate to declare positively that the Kudur-mabug
     and Kudur-nakhunta of the inscriptions are one and the same
     with the Kudur-lagamar (Chedor-laomer) of the Bible.
     Finally, Schrader, while he repudiates Smith&rsquo;s view, agrees
     in the main fact with the other Assyriologists. On the other
     hand, the majority of modern Biblical critics have
     absolutely refused to credit the story in Genesis. Sayce
     thinks that the Bible story rests on an historic basis, and
     his view is strongly confirmed by Pinches&rsquo;discovery of a
     Chaldæan document which mentions Kudur-lagamar and two of
     his allies. The Hebrew historiographer reproduced an
     authentic fact from the chronicles of Babylon, and connected
     it with one of the events in the life of Abraham. The very
     late date generally assigned to Gen. xiv. in no way
     diminishes the intrinsic probability of the facts narrated
     by the Chaldæan document which is preserved to us in the
     pages of the Hebrew book.

    <p>
      In the thirteenth year of his reign over the East, the cities of the Dead
      Sea&mdash;Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, Zeboîm, and Belâ&mdash;revolted against
      him: he immediately convoked his great vassals, Amraphel of Chaldæa,
      Ariôch of Ellasar,* Tida&rsquo;lo the Guti, and marched with them to the
      confines of his dominions. Tradition has invested many of the tribes then
      inhabiting Southern Syria with semi-mythical names and attributes. They
      are represented as being giants&mdash;Rephalm; men of prodigious strength&mdash;Zuzîm;
      as having a buzzing and indistinct manner of speech&mdash;Zamzummîm; as
      formidable monsters**&mdash;Emîm or Anakîm, before whom other nations
      appeared as grasshoppers;*** as the Horîm who were encamped on the
      confines of the Sinaitic desert, and as the Amalekites who ranged over the
      mountains to the west of the Dead Sea. Kudur-lagamar defeated them one
      after another&mdash;the Rephaîm near to Ashtaroth-Karnaîm, the Zuzîm near
      Ham,**** the Amîm at Shaveh-Kiriathaim, and the Horîm on the spurs of
      Mount Seir as far as El-Paran; then retracing his footsteps, he entered
      the country of the Amalekites by way of En-mishpat, and pillaged the
      Amorites of Hazazôn-Tamar.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ellasar has been identified with Larsa since the
     researches of Rawlin-son and Norris; the Goîm, over whom
     Tidal was king, with the Guti.

     ** Sayce considers Zuzîm and Zamzummîm to be two readings of
     the same word Zamzum, written in cuneiform characters on the
     original document. The sounds represented, in the Hebrew
     alphabet, by the letters m and w, are expressed in the
     Chaldæan syllabary by the same character, and a Hebrew or
     Babylonian scribe, who had no other means of telling the
     true pronunciation of a race-name mentioned in the story of
     this campaign, would have been quite as much at a loss as
     any modern scholar to say whether he ought to transcribe the
     word as Z-m-z-m or as Z-w-z-vo; some scribes read it
     <i>Zuzîm,</i> others preferred <i>Zamzummîm.</i>

     *** <i>Numb.</i> xiii. 33.

     **** In Deut. ii. 20 it is stated that the Zamzummîm lived
     in the country of Ammon. Sayce points out that we often find
     the variant Am for the character usually read <i>Ham</i> or
     <i>Kham</i>&mdash;the name Khammurabi, for instance, is often found
     written Ammurabi; the Ham in the narrative of Genesis would,
     therefore, be identical with the land of Ammon in
     Deuteronomy, and the difference between the spelling of the
     two would be due to the fact that the document reproduced in
     the XIVIIth chapter of Genesis had been originally copied from
     a cuneiform tablet in which the name of the place was
     expressed by the sign <i>Ham-Am.</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      In the mean time, the kings of the five towns had concentrated their
      troops in the vale of Siddîm, and were there resolutely awaiting
      Kudur-lagamar. They were, however, completely routed, some of the
      fugitives being swallowed up in the pits of bitumen with which the soil
      abounded, while others with difficulty reached the mountains.
      Kudur-lagamar sacked Sodom and Gomorrah, re-established his dominion on
      all sides, and returned laden with booty, Hebrew tradition adding that he
      was overtaken near the sources of the Jordan by the patriarch Abraham.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An attempt has been made to identify the three vassals of
     Kudur-lagamar with kings mentioned on the Chaldæan
     monuments. Tidcal, or, if we adopt the Septuagint variant,
     Thorgal, has been considered by some as the bearer of a
     Sumorian name, Turgal= &ldquo;great chief,&rdquo; &ldquo;great son,&rdquo; while
     others put him on one side as not having been a Babylonian;
     Pinches, Sayce, and Hommel identify him with Tudkhula, an
     ally of Kudur-lagamar against Khammurabi. Schrader was the
     first to suggest that Amraphel was really Khammurabi, and
     emended the Amraphel of the biblical text into Amraphi or
     Amrabi, in order to support this identification. Halévy,
     while on the whole accepting this theory, derives the name
     from the pronunciation Kimtarapashtum or Kimtarapaltum,
     which he attributes to the name generally read Khammurabi,
     and in this he is partly supported by Hommel, who reads
     &ldquo;Khammurapaltu.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After his victory over Kudur-lagamar, Khammurabi assumed the title of King
      of Martu,* which we find still borne by Ammisatana sixty years later.** We
      see repeated here almost exactly what took place in Ethiopia at the time
      of its conquest by Egypt: merchants had prepared the way for military
      occupation, and the civilization of Babylon had taken hold on the people
      long before its kings had become sufficiently powerful to claim them as
      vassals. The empire may be said to have been virtually established from
      the day when the states of the Middle and Lower Euphrates formed but one
      kingdom in the hands of a single ruler. We must not, however, imagine it
      to have been a compact territory, divided into provinces under military
      occupation, ruled by a uniform code of laws and statutes, and administered
      throughout by functionaries of various grades, who received their orders
      from Babylon or Susa, according as the chances of war favoured the
      ascendency of Chaldæa or Elam. It was in reality a motley assemblage of
      tribes and principalities, whose sole bond of union was subjection to a
      common yoke.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is, indeed, the sole title which he attributes to
     himself on a stone tablet now in the British Museum.

     ** In an inscription by this prince, copied probably about
     the time of Nabonidus by the scribe Belushallîm, he is
     called &ldquo;king of the vast land of Martu.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They were under obligation to pay tribute, and furnish military
      contingents and show other external marks of obedience, but their
      particular constitution, customs, and religion were alike respected: they
      had to purchase, at the cost of a periodical ransom, the right to live in
      their own country after their own fashion, and the head of the empire
      forbore all interference in their affairs, except in cases where the
      internecine quarrels and dissensions threatened the security of his
      suzerainty. Their subordination lasted as best it could, sometimes for a
      year or for ten years, at the end of which period they would neglect the
      obligations of their vassalage, or openly refuse to fulfil them: a revolt
      would then break out at one point or another, and it was necessary to
      suppress it without delay to prevent the bad example from spreading far
      and wide. The empire was maintained by perpetual re-conquests, and its
      extent varied with the energy shown by its chiefs, or with the resources
      which were for the moment available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separated from the confines of the empire by only a narrow isthmus, Egypt
      loomed on the horizon, and appeared to beckon to her rival. Her natural
      fertility, the industry of her inhabitants, the stores of gold and
      perfumes which she received from the heart of Ethiopia, were well known by
      the passage to and fro of her caravans, and the recollection of her
      treasures must have frequently provoked the envy of Asiatic courts. Egypt
      had, however, strangely declined from her former greatness, and the line
      of princes who governed her had little in common with the Pharaohs who had
      rendered her name so formidable under the XIIth dynasty. She was now under
      the rule of the Xoites, whose influence was probably confined to the
      Delta, and extended merely in name over the Said and Nubia. The feudal
      lords, ever ready to reassert their independence as soon as the central
      power waned, shared between them the possession of the Nile valley below
      Memphis: the princes of Thebes, who were probably descendants of
      Usirtasen, owned the largest fiefdom, and though some slight scruple may
      have prevented them from donning the pschënt or placing their names within
      a cartouche, they assumed notwithstanding the plenitude of royal power. A
      favourable opportunity was therefore offered to an invader, and the
      Chaldæans might have attacked with impunity a people thus divided among
      themselves.* They stopped short, however, at the southern frontier of
      Syria, or if they pushed further forward, it was without any important
      result: distance from head-quarters, or possibly reiterated attacks of the
      Elamites, prevented them from placing in the field an adequate force for
      such a momentous undertaking. What they had not dared to venture, others
      more audacious were to accomplish. At this juncture, so runs the Egyptian
      record, &ldquo;there came to us a king named Timaios. Under this king, then, I
      know not wherefore, the god caused to blow upon us a baleful wind, and in
      the face of all probability bands from the East, people of ignoble race,
      came upon us unawares, attacked the country, and subdued it easily and
      without fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The theory that the divisions of Egypt, under the XIVth
     dynasty, and the discords between its feudatory princes,
     were one of the main causes of the success of the Shepherds,
     is now admitted to be correct.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is possible that they owed this rapid victory to the presence in their
      armies of a factor hitherto unknown to the African&mdash;the war-chariot&mdash;and
      before the horse and his driver the Egyptians gave way in a body.* The
      invaders appeared as a cloud of locusts on the banks of the Nile. Towns
      and temples were alike pillaged, burnt, and ruined; they massacred all
      they could of the male population, reduced to slavery those of the women
      and children whose lives they spared, and then proclaimed as king Salatis,
      one of their chiefs.** He established a semblance of regular government,
      chose Memphis as his capital, and imposed a tax upon the vanquished. Two
      perils, however, immediately threatened the security of his triumph: in
      the south the Theban lords, taking matters into their own hands after the
      downfall of the Xoites, refused the oath of allegiance to Salatis, and
      organized an obstinate resistance;*** in the north he had to take measures
      to protect himself against an attack of the Chaldæans or of the Élamites
      who were oppressing Chaldæa.****
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The horse was unknown, or at any rate had not been
     employed in. Egypt prior to the invasion; we find it,
     however, in general use immediately after the expulsion of
     the Shepherds, see the tomb of Pihiri. Moreover, all
     historians agree in admitting that it was introduced into
     the country under the rule of the Shepherds. The use of the
     war-chariot in Chaldæa at an epoch prior to the Hyksôs
     invasion, is proved by a fragment of the Vulture Stele; it
     is therefore, natural to suppose that the Hyksôs used the
     chariot in war, and that the rapidity of their conquest was
     due to it.

     ** The name Salatis (var. Saitôs) seems to be derived from a
     Semitic word, Siialît = &ldquo;the chief,&rdquo; &ldquo;the governor;&rdquo; this
     was the title which Joseph received when Pharaoh gave him
     authority over the whole of Egypt (Gen. xli. 43). Salatis
     may not, therefore, have been the real name of the first
     Hyksôs king, but his title, which the Egyptians
     misunderstood, and from which they evolved a proper name:
     Uhlemann has, indeed, deduced from this that Manetho, being
     familiar with the passage referring to Joseph, had forged
     the name of Salatis. Ebers imagined that he could decipher
     the Egyptian form of this prince&rsquo;s name on the Colossus of
     Tell-Mokdam, where Naville has since read with certainty the
     name of a Pharaoh of the XIIIth and XIVth dynasties,
     Nahsiri.

     *** The text of Manetho speaks of taxes which he imposed on
     the high and low lands, which would seem to include the
     Thebaid in the kingdom; it is, however, stated in the next
     few pages that the successors of Salatis waged an incessant
     war against the Egyptians, which can only refer to
     hostilities against the Thebans. We are forced, therefore,
     to admit, either that Manetho took the title of lord of the
     high and low lands which belonged to Salatis, literally, or
     that the Thebans, after submitting at first, subsequently
     refused to pay tribute, thus provoking a war.

     **** Manetho here speaks of Assyrians; this is an error
     which is to be explained by the imperfect state of
     historical knowledge in Greece at the time of the Macedonian
     supremacy. We need not for this reason be led to cast doubt
     upon the historic value of the narrative: we must remember
     the suzerainty which the kings of Babylon exercised over
     Syria, and read <i>Chaldæans</i> where Manetho has written
     <i>Assyrians</i>. In Herodotus &ldquo;Assyria&rdquo; is the regular term for
     &ldquo;Babylonia,&rdquo; and Babylonia is called &ldquo;the land of the
     Assyrians.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      From the natives of the Delta, who were temporarily paralysed by their
      reverses, he had, for the moment, little to fear: restricting himself,
      therefore, to establishing forts at the strategic points in the Nile
      valley in order to keep the Thebans in check, he led the main body of his
      troops to the frontier on the isthmus. Pacific immigrations had already
      introduced Asiatic settlers into the Delta, and thus prepared the way for
      securing the supremacy of the new rulers; in the midst of these strangers,
      and on the ruins of the ancient town of Hâwârît-Avaris, in the Sethro&rsquo;ifce
      nome&mdash;a place connected by tradition with the myth of Osiris and
      Typhon&mdash;Salatis constructed an immense entrenched camp, capable of
      sheltering two hundred and forty thousand men. He visited it yearly to
      witness the military manoeuvres, to pay his soldiers, and to preside over
      the distribution of rations. This permanent garrison protected him from a
      Chaldæan invasion, a not unlikely event as long as Syria remained under
      the supremacy of the Babylonian kings; it furnished his successors also
      with an inexhaustible supply of trained soldiers, thus enabling them to
      complete the conquest of Lower Egypt. Years elapsed before the princes of
      the south would declare themselves vanquished, and five kings&mdash;Anôn,
      Apachnas, Apôphis I., Iannas, and Asses&mdash;passed their lifetime &ldquo;in a
      perpetual warfare, desirous of tearing up Egypt to the very root.&rdquo; These
      Theban kings, who were continually under arms against the barbarians, were
      subsequently classed in a dynasty by themselves, the XVth of Manetho, but
      they at last succumbed to the invader, and Asses became master of the
      entire country. His successors in their turn formed a dynasty, the XVIth,
      the few remaining monuments of which are found scattered over the length
      and breadth of the valley from the shores of the Mediterranean to the
      rocks of the first cataract.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptians who witnessed the advent of this Asiatic people called them
      by the general term Amûû, Asiatics, or Monâtiû, the men of the desert.*
      They had already given the Bedouin the opprobrious epithet of Shaûsû&mdash;pillagers
      or robbers&mdash;which aptly described them;** and they subsequently
      applied the same name to the intruders&mdash;Hiq Shaûsû&mdash;from which
      the Greeks derived their word Hyksôs, or Hykoussôs, for this people.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The meaning of the term <i>Monîti</i> was discovered by E. de
     Rougé, who translated it <i>Shepherd</i>, and applied it to the
     Hyksôs; from thence it passed into the works of all the
     Egyptologists who concerned themselves with this question,
     but <i>Shepherd</i> has not been universally accepted as the
     meaning of the word. It is generally agreed that it was a
     generic term, indicating the races with which their
     conquerors were supposed to be connected, and not the
     particular term of which Manetho&rsquo;s word <i>Hoiveves</i> would be
     the literal translation.

     ** The name seems, in fact, to be derived from a word which
     meant &ldquo;to rob,&rdquo; &ldquo;to pillage.&rdquo; The name Shausu, Shosu, was
     not used by the Egyptians to indicate a particular race. It
     was used of all Bedouins, and in general of all the
     marauding tribes who infested the desert or the mountains.
     The Shausu most frequently referred to on the monuments are
     those from the desert between Egypt and Syria, but there is
     a reference, in the time of Ramses II., to those from the
     Lebanon and the valley of Orontes. Krall finds an allusion
     to them in a word (<i>Shosim</i>) in <i>Judges</i> ii. 14, which is
     generally translated by a generic expression, &ldquo;the
     spoilers.&rdquo;

     *** Manetho declares that the people were called Hyksôs,
     from <i>Syk</i>, which means &ldquo;king&rdquo; in the sacred language, and
     <i>sôs</i>, which means &ldquo;shepherd&rdquo; in the popular language. As a
     matter of fact, the word <i>Hyku</i> means &ldquo;prince &ldquo;in the
     classical language of Egypt, or, as Manetho styles it, the
     <i>sacred language</i>, i.e. in the idiom of the old religious,
     historical, and literary texts, which in later ages the
     populace no longer understood. Shôs, on the contrary,
     belongs to the spoken language of the later time, and does
     not occur in the ancient inscriptions, so that Manetho&rsquo;s
     explanation is valueless; there is but one material fact to
     be retained from his evidence, and that is the name <i>Hyk-
     Shôs</i> or <i>Hyku-Shôs</i> given by its inventors to the alien
     kings. Cham-pollion and Rosellini were the first to identify
     these Shôs with the Shaûsû whom they found represented on
     the monuments, and their opinion, adopted by some, seems to
     me an extremely plausible one: the Egyptians, at a given
     moment, bestowed the generic name of Shaûsû on these
     strangers, just as they had given those of Amûû and Manâtiû.
     The texts or writers from whom Manetho drew his information
     evidently mentioned certain kings <i>hyku</i>-Shaûsû; other
     passages, or, the same passages wrongly interpreted, were
     applied to the race, and were rendered <i>hyku</i>-Shaûsû = &ldquo;the
     <i>prisoners</i> taken from the Shaûsû,&rdquo; a substantive derived
     from the root <i>haka</i> = &ldquo;to take&rdquo; being substituted for the
     noun <i>hyqu</i> = &ldquo;prince.&rdquo; Josephus declares, on the authority
     of Manetho, that some manuscripts actually suggested this
     derivation&mdash;a fact which is easily explained by the custom
     of the Egyptian record offices. I may mention, in passing,
     that Mariette recognised in the element &ldquo;<i>Sôs</i>&rdquo; an Egyptian
     word <i>shôs</i> = &ldquo;soldiers,&rdquo; and in the name of King Mîrmâshâû,
     which he read Mîrshôsû, an equivalent of the title Hyq-
     Shôsû.
</pre>
    <p>
      But we are without any clue as to their real name, language, or origin.
      The writers of classical times were unable to come to an agreement on
      these questions: some confounded the Hyksôs with the Phoenicians, others
      regarded them as Arabs.* Modern scholars have put forward at least a dozen
      contradictory hypotheses on the matter. The Hyksôs have been asserted to
      have been Canaanites, Elamites, Hittites, Accadians, Scythians. The last
      opinion found great favour with the learned, as long as they could believe
      that the sphinxes discovered by Mariette represented Apôphis or one of his
      predecessors. As a matter of fact, these monuments present all the
      characteristics of the Mongoloid type of countenance&mdash;the small and
      slightly oblique eyes, the arched but somewhat flattened nose, the
      pronounced cheekbones and well-covered jaw, the salient chin and full lips
      slightly depressed at the corners.** These peculiarities are also observed
      in the three heads found at Damanhur, in the colossal torso dug up at
      Mit-Farês in the Fayum, in the twin figures of the Nile removed to the
      Bulaq Museum from Tanis, and upon the remains of a statue in the
      collection at the Villa Ludovisi in Rome. The same foreign type of face is
      also found to exist among the present inhabitants of the villages
      scattered over the eastern part of the Delta, particularly on the shores
      of Lake Menzaleh, and the conclusion was drawn that these people were the

     * Manetho takes them to be Phoenicians, but he adds that
     certain writers thought them to be Arabs: Brugsch favours
     this latter view, but the Arab legend of a conquest of Egypt
     by Sheddâd and the Adites is of recent origin, and was
     inspired by traditions in regard to the Hyksôs current
     during the Byzantine epoch; we cannot, therefore, allow it
     to influence us. We must wait before expressing a definite
     opinion in regard to the facts which Glaser believes he has
     obtained from the Minoan inscriptions which date from the
     time of the Hyksôs.

     ** Mariette, who was the first to describe these curious
     monuments, recognised in them all the incontestable
     characteristics of a Semitic type, and the correctness of
     his view was, at first, universally admitted. Later on Hamy
     imagined that he could distinguish traces of Mongolian
     influences, and Er. Lenormant, and then Mariette himself
     came round to this view; it has recently been supported in
     England by Flower, and in Germany by Virchow.

    <p>
      This theory was abandoned, however, when it was ascertained that the
      sphinxes of San had been carved, many centuries before the invasion, for
      Amenemhâît III., a king of the XIIth dynasty. In spite of the facts we
      possess, the problem therefore still remains unsolved, and the origin of
      the Hyksôs is as mysterious as ever. We gather, however, that the third
      millennium before our era was repeatedly disturbed by considerable
      migratory movements. The expeditions far afield of Elamite and Chaldæan
      princes could not have taken place without seriously perturbing the
      regions over which they passed. They must have encountered by the way many
      nomadic or unsettled tribes whom a slight shock would easily displace. An
      impulse once given, it needed but little to accelerate or increase the
      movement: a collision with one horde reacted on its neighbours, who either
      displaced or carried others with them, and the whole multitude, gathering
      momentum as they went, were precipitated in the direction first given.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Hyksôs invasion has been regarded as a natural result
     of the Elamite conquest.

      A tradition, picked up by Herodotus on his travels, relates that the
      Phoenicians had originally peopled the eastern and southern shores of the
      Persian Gulf;* it was also said that Indathyrses, a Scythian king, had
      victoriously scoured the whole of Asia, and had penetrated as far as
      Egypt.** Either of these invasions may have been the cause of the Syrian
      migration. In. comparison with the meagre information which has come down
      to us under the form of legends, it is provoking to think how much actual
      fact has been lost, a tithe of which would explain the cause of the
      movement and the mode of its execution. The least improbable hypothesis is
      that which attributes the appearance of the Shepherds about the XXIIIrd
      century B.C., to the arrival in Naharaim of those Khati who subsequently
      fought so obstinately against the armies both of the Pharaohs and the
      Ninevite kings. They descended from the mountain region in which the Halys
      and the Euphrates take their rise, and if the bulk of them proceeded no
      further than the valleys of the Taurus and the Amanos, some at least must
      have pushed forward as far as the provinces on the western shores of the
      Dead Sea. The most adventurous among them, reinforced by the Canaanites
      and other tribes who had joined them on their southward course, crossed
      the isthmus of Suez, and finding a people weakened by discord, experienced
      no difficulty in replacing the native dynasties by their own barbarian
      chiefs.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was to the exodus of this race, in the last analysis,
     that the invasion of the shepherds may be attributed

     ** A certain number of commentators are of opinion that the
     wars attributed to Indathyrses have been confounded with
     what Herodotus tells of the exploits of Madyes, and are
     nothing more than a distorted remembrance of the great
     Scythian invasion which took place in the latter half of the
     VIIth century B.C.

     *** At the present time, those scholars who admit the
     Turanian origin of the Hyksôs are of opinion that only the
     nucleus of the race, the royal tribe, was composed of
     Mongols, while the main body consisted of elements of all
     kinds&mdash;Canaanitish, or, more generally, Semitic.

      Both their name and origin were doubtless well known to the Egyptians, but
      the latter nevertheless disdained to apply to them any term but that of
      &ldquo;she-maû,&rdquo; * strangers, and in referring to them used the same vague
      appellations which they applied to the Bedouin of the Sinaitic peninsula,&mdash;Monâtiû,
      the shepherds, or Sâtiû, the archers. They succeeded in hiding the
      original name of their conquerors so thoroughly, that in the end they
      themselves forgot it, and kept the secret of it from posterity.

      The remembrance of the cruelties with which the invaders sullied their
      conquest lived long after them; it still stirred the anger of Manetho
      after a lapse of twenty centuries.** The victors were known as the
      &ldquo;Plagues&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pests,&rdquo; and every possible crime and impiety was attributed

      But the brutalities attending the invasion once past, the invaders soon
      lost their barbarity and became rapidly civilized. Those of them stationed
      in the encampment at Avaris retained the military qualities and
      characteristic energy of their race; the remainder became assimilated to
      their new compatriots, and were soon recognisable merely by their long
      hair, thick beard, and marked features. Their sovereigns seemed to have
      realised from the first that it was more to their interest to exploit the
      country than to pillage it; as, however, none of them was competent to
      understand the intricacies of the treasury, they were forced to retain the
      services of the majority of the scribes, who had managed the public
      accounts under the native kings.* Once schooled to the new state of
      affairs, they readily adopted the refinements of civilized life.

      The court of the Pharaohs, with its pomp and its usual assemblage of
      officials, both great and small, was revived around the person of the new
      sovereign;* the titles of the Amenemhâîts and the Usirtasens, adapted to
      these &ldquo;princes of foreign lands,&rdquo; ** legitimatised them as descendants of
      Horus and sons of the Sun.*** They respected the local religions, and went
      so far as to favour those of the gods whose attributes appeared to connect
      them with some of their own barbarous divinities. The chief deity of their
      worship was Baal, the lord of all,**** a cruel and savage warrior; his
      resemblance to Sit, the brother and enemy of Osiris, was so marked, that
      he was identified with the Egyptian deity, with the emphatic additional
      title of Sutkhû, the Great Sit.^
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The narrative of the <i>Sallier Papyrus,</i> No. 1, shows us
     the civil and military chiefs collected round the Shepherd-
     king Apôpi, and escorting him in the solemn processions in
     honour of the gods. They are followed by the scribes and
     magicians, who give him advice on important occasions.

     ** Hiqu Situ: this is the title of Abîsha at Beni-Hassan,
     which is also assumed by Khiani on several small monuments;
     Steindorff has attempted to connect it with the name of the
     Hyksôs.

     *** The preamble of the two or three Shepherd-kings of whom
     we know anything, contains the two cartouches, the special
     titles, and the names of Horus, which formed part of the
     title of the kings of pure Egyptian race; thus Apôphis IL is
     proclaimed to be the living Horus, who joins the two earths
     in peace, the good god, Aqnunrî, son of the Sun, Apôpi, who
     lives for ever, on the statues of Mîrmâshâu, which he had
     appropriated, and on the pink granite table of offerings in
     the Gizeh Museum.

     **** The name of Baal, transcribed Baâlu, is found on that
     of a certain Petebaâlû, &ldquo;the Gift of Baal,&rdquo; who must have
     flourished in the time of the last shepherd-kings, or rather
     under the Theban kings of the XVIIth dynasty, who were their
     contemporaries, whose conclusions have been adopted by
     Brugsch.

     ^ Sutikhû, Sutkhû, are lengthened forms of Sûtû, or Sîtû;
     and Chabas, who had at first denied the existence of the
     final <i>Jehû</i>, afterwards himself supplied the philological
     arguments which proved the correctness of the reading: he
     rightly refused, however, to recognise in Sutikhû or Sutkhû
     &mdash;the name of the conquerors&rsquo; god&mdash;a transliteration of the
     Phoenician Sydyk, and would only see in it that of the
     nearest Egyptian deity. This view is now accepted as the
     right one, and Sutkhû is regarded as the indigenous
     equivalent of the great Asiatic god, elsewhere called Baal,
     or supreme lord. [Professor Pétrie found a scarab bearing

      He was usually represented as a fully armed warrior, wearing a helmet of
      circular form, ornamented with two plumes; but he also borrowed the
      emblematic animal of Sît, the fennec, and the winged griffin which haunted
      the deserts of the Thebaid. His temples were erected in the cities of the
      Delta, side by side with the sanctuaries of the feudal gods, both at
      Bubastis and at Tanis. Tanis, now made the capital, reopened its palaces,
      and acquired a fresh impetus from the royal presence within its walls.
      Apôphis Aq-nûnrî, one of its kings, dedicated several tables of offerings
      in that city, and engraved his cartouches upon the sphinxes and standing
      colossi of the Pharaohs of the XIIth and XIIIth dynasties.

      He was, however, honest enough to leave the inscriptions of his
      predecessors intact, and not to appropriate to himself the credit of works
      belonging to the Amenemhâîts or to Mirmâshâû. Khianî, who is possibly the
      Iannas of Manetho, was not, however, so easily satisfied.* The statue
      bearing his inscription, of which the lower part was discovered by Naville
      at Bubastis, appears to have been really carved for himself or for one of
      his contemporaries. It is a work possessing no originality, though of very
      commendable execution, such as would render it acceptable to any museum;
      the artist who conceived it took &lsquo;his inspiration with considerable
      cleverness from the best examples turned out by the schools of the Delta
      under the Sovkhotpfts and the Nofirhotpûs. But a small grey granite lion,
      also of the reign of Khianî, which by a strange fate had found its way to
      Bagdad, does not raise our estimation of the modelling of animals in the
      Hyksôs period.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Naville, who reads the name Râyan or Yanrâ, thinks that
     this prince must be the Annas or Iannas mentioned by Manetho
     as being one of the six shepherd-kings of the XVth dynasty.
     Mr. Pétrie proposed to read Khian, Khianî, and the fragment
     discovered at Gebeleîn confirms this reading, as well as a
     certain number of cylinders and scarabs. Mr. Pétrie prefers
     to place this Pharaoh in the VIIIth dynasty, and makes him
     one of the leaders in the foreign occupation to which he
     supposes Egypt to have submitted at that time; but it is
     almost certain that he ought to be placed among the Hyksôs
     of the XVIth dynasty. The name Khianî, more correctly
     Khiyanî or Kheyanî, is connected by Tomkins, and Hilprecht
     with that of a certain Khayanû or Khayan, son of Gabbar, who
     reigned in Amanos in the time of Salmanasar II., King of
     Assyria.

      It is heavy in form, and the muzzle in no way recalls the fine profile of
      the lions executed by the sculptors of earlier times. The pursuit of
      science and the culture of learning appear to have been more successfully
      perpetuated than the fine arts; a treatise on mathematics, of which a copy
      has come down to us, would seem to have been recopied, if not remodelled,
      in the twenty-second year of Apôphis IL Aûsirrî. If we only possessed more
      monuments or documents treating of this period, we should doubtless
      perceive that their sojourn on the banks of the Nile was instrumental in
      causing a speedy change in the appearance and character of the Hyksôs. The
      strangers retained to a certain extent their coarse countenances and rude
      manners: they showed no aptitude for tilling the soil or sowing grain, but
      delighted in the marshy expanses of the Delta, where they gave themselves
      up to a semi-savage life of hunting and of tending cattle. The nobles
      among them, clothed and schooled after the Egyptian fashion, and holding
      fiefs, or positions at court, differed but little from the native feudal
      chiefs. We see here a case of what generally happens when a horde of
      barbarians settles down in a highly organised country which by a stroke of
      fortune they may have conquered; as soon as the Hyksôs had taken complete
      possession of Egypt, Egypt in her turn took possession of them, and those
      who survived the enervating effect of her civilization were all but
      transformed into Egyptians.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, in the time of the native Pharaohs, Asiatic tribes had been drawn
      towards Egypt, where they were treated as subjects or almost as slaves,
      the attraction which she possessed for them must have increased in
      intensity under the shepherds. They would now find the country in the
      hands of men of the same races as themselves&mdash;Egyptianised, it is
      true, but not to such an extent as to have completely lost their own
      language and the knowledge of their own extraction. Such immigrants were
      the more readily welcomed, since there lurked a feeling among the Hyksôs
      that it was necessary to strengthen themselves against the slumbering
      hostility of the indigenous population. The royal palace must have more
      than once opened its gates to Asiatic counsellors and favourites.
      Canaanites and Bedouin must often have been enlisted for the camp at
      Avaris. Invasions, famines, civil wars, all seem to have conspired to
      drive into Egypt not only isolated individuals, but whole families and
      tribes. That of the Beni-Israel, or Israelites, who entered the country
      about this time, has since acquired a unique position in the world&rsquo;s
      history. They belonged to that family of Semitic extraction which we know
      by the monuments and tradition to have been scattered in ancient times
      along the western shores of the Persian Gulf and on the banks of the
      Euphrates. Those situated nearest to Chaldæa and to the sea probably led a
      settled existence; they cultivated the soil, they employed themselves in
      commerce and industries, their vessels&mdash;from Dilmun, from Mâgan, and
      from Milukhkha&mdash;coasted from one place to another, and made their way
      to the cities of Sumer and Accad. They had been civilized from very early
      times, and some of their towns were situated on islands, so as to be
      protected from sudden incursions. Other tribes of the same family occupied
      the interior of the continent; they lived in tents, and delighted in the
      unsettled life of nomads. There appeared to be in this distant corner of
      Arabia an inexhaustible reserve of population, which periodically
      overflowed its borders and spread over the world. It was from this very
      region that we see the Kashdim, the true Chaldæans, issuing ready armed
      for combat,&mdash;a people whose name was subsequently used to denote
      several tribes settled between the lower waters of the Tigris and the
      Euphrates. It was there, among the marshes on either side of these rivers,
      that the Aramoans established their first settlements after quitting the
      desert. There also the oldest legends of the race placed the cradle of the
      Phoenicians; it was even believed, about the time of Alexander, that the
      earliest ruins attributable to this people had been discovered on the
      Bahrein Islands, the largest of which, Tylos and Arados, bore names
      resembling the two great ports of Tyre and Arvad. We are indebted to
      tradition for the cause of their emigration and the route by which they
      reached the Mediterranean. The occurrence of violent earthquakes forced
      them to leave their home; they travelled as far as the Lake of Syria,
      where they halted for some time; then resuming their march, did not rest
      till they had reached the sea, where they founded Sidon. The question
      arises as to the position of the Lake of Syria on whose shores they
      rested, some believing it to be the Bahr-î-Nedjif and the environs of
      Babylon; others, the Lake of Bambykês near the Euphrates, the emigrants
      doubtless having followed up the course of that river, and having
      approached the country of their destination on its north-eastern frontier.
      Another theory would seek to identify the lake with the waters of Merom,
      the Lake of Galilee, or the Dead Sea; in this case the horde must have
      crossed the neck of the Arabian peninsula, from the Euphrates to the
      Jordan, through one of those long valleys, sprinkled with oases, which
      afforded an occasional route for caravans.* Several writers assure us that
      the Phoenician tradition of this exodus was misunderstood by Herodotus,
      and that the sea which they remembered on reaching Tyre was not the
      Persian Gulf, but the Dead Sea. If this had been the case, they need not
      have hesitated to assign their departure to causes mentioned in other
      documents. The Bible tells us that, soon after the invasion of
      Kudur-lagamar, the anger of God being kindled by the wickedness of Sodom
      and Gomorrah, He resolved to destroy the five cities situated in the
      valley of Siddim. A cloud of burning brimstone broke over them and
      consumed them; when the fumes and smoke, as &ldquo;of a furnace,&rdquo; had passed
      away, the very site of the towns had disappeared.** Previous to their
      destruction, the lake into which the Jordan empties itself had had but a
      restricted area: the subsidence of the southern plain, which had been
      occupied by the impious cities, doubled the size of the lake, and enlarged
      it to its present dimensions. The earthquake which caused the Phoenicians
      to leave their ancestral home may have been the result of this cataclysm,
      and the sea on whose shores they sojourned would thus be our Dead Sea.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * They would thus have arrived at the shores of Lake Merom,
     or at the shores either of the Dead Sea or of the Lake of
     Gennesareth; the Arab traditions speak of an itinerary which
     would have led the emigrants across the desert, but they
     possess no historic value is so far as these early epochs
     are concerned.

     ** <i>Gen.</i> xix. 24-29; the whole of this episode belongs to
     the Jehovistic narrative.
</pre>
    <p>
      One fact, however, appears to be certain in the midst of many hypotheses,
      and that is that the Phoenicians had their origin in the regions bordering
      on the Persian Gulf. It is useless to attempt, with the inadequate
      materials as yet in our possession, to determine by what route they
      reached the Syrian coast, though we may perhaps conjecture the period of
      their arrival. Herodotus asserts that the Tyrians placed the date of the
      foundation of their principal temple two thousand three hundred years
      before the time of his visit, and the erection of a sanctuary for their
      national deity would probably take place very soon after their settlement
      at Tyre: this would bring their arrival there to about the XXVIIIth
      century before our era. The Elamite and Babylonian conquests would
      therefore have found the Phoenicians already established in the country,
      and would have had appreciable effect upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question now arises whether the Beni-Israel belonged to the group of
      tribes which included the Phoenicians, or whether they were of Chaldæan
      race. Their national traditions leave no doubt upon that point. They are
      regarded as belonging to an important race, which we find dispersed over
      the country of Padan-Aram, in Northern Mesopotamia, near the base of Mount
      Masios, and extending on both sides of the Euphrates.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The country of Padan-Aram is situated between the
     Euphrates and the upper reaches of the Khabur, on both sides
     of the Balikh, and is usually explained as the &ldquo;plain&rdquo; or
     &ldquo;table-land&rdquo; of Aram, though the etymology is not certain;
     the word seems to be preserved in that of Tell-Faddân, near
     Harrân.

      Their earliest chiefs bore the names of towns or of peoples,&mdash;N
      akhor, Peleg, and Serug:* all were descendants of Arphaxad,** and it was
      related that Terakh, the direct ancestor of the Israelites, had dwelt in
      Ur-Kashdîm, the Ur or Uru of the Chaldæans.*** He is said to have had
      three sons&mdash;Abraham, Nakhôr, and Harân. Harân begat Lot, but died
      before his father in Ur-Kashdîm, his own country; Abraham and Nakhor both
      took wives, but Abraham&rsquo;s wife remained a long time barren. Then Terakh,
      with his son Abraham, his grandson Lot, the son of Harân, and his
      daughter-in-law Sarah,**** went forth from Ur-Kashdîm (Ur of the Chaldees)
      to go into the land of Canaan.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Nakhôr has been associated with the ancient village of
     Khaura, or with the ancient village of Hâditha-en-Naura, to
     the south of Anah; Peleg probably corresponds with Phalga or
     Phaliga, which was situated at the mouth of the Khabur;
     Serug with the present Sarudj in the neighbourhood of
     Edessa, and the other names in the genealogy were probably
     borrowed from as many different localities.

     ** The site of Arphaxad is doubtful, as is also its meaning:
     its second element is undoubtedly the name of the Chaldæans,
     but the first is interpreted in several ways&mdash;&ldquo;frontier of
     the Chaldæans,&rdquo; &ldquo;domain of the Chaldæans.&rdquo; The similarity of
     sound was the cause of its being for a long time associated
     with the Arrapakhitis of classical times; the tendency is
     now to recognise in it the country nearest to the ancient
     domain of the Chaldæans, i.e. Babylonia proper.

     *** Ur-Kashdîm has long been sought for in the north, either
     at Orfa, in accordance with the tradition of the Syrian
     Churches still existing in the East, or in a certain Ur of
     Mesopotamia, placed by Ammianus Marcellinus between Nisibis
     and the Tigris; at the present day Halévy still looks for it
     on the Syrian bank of the Euphrates, to the south-east of
     Thapsacus. Rawlin-son&rsquo;s proposal to identify it with the
     town of Uru has been successively accepted by nearly all
     Assyriologists. Sayce remarks that the worship of Sin, which
     was common to both towns, established a natural link between
     them, and that an inhabitant of Uru would have felt more at
     home in Harrân than in any other town.

     **** The names of Sarah and Abraham, or rather the earlier
     form, Abram, have been found, the latter under the form
     Abirâmu, in the contracts of the first Chaldæan empire.
</pre>
    <p>
      And they came unto Kharân, and dwelt there, and Terakh died in Kharân.* It
      is a question whether Kharân is to be identified with Harrân in
      Mesopotamia, the city of the god Sin; or, which is more probable, with the
      Syrian town of Haurân, in the neighbourhood of Damascus. The tribes who
      crossed the Euphrates became subsequently a somewhat important people.
      They called themselves, or were known by others, as the &lsquo;Ibrîm, or
      Hebrews, the people from beyond the river;** and this appellation, which
      we are accustomed to apply to the children of Israel only, embraced also,
      at the time when the term was most extended, the Ammonites, Moabites,
      Edomites, Ishmaelites, Midianites, and many other tribes settled on the
      borders of the desert to the east and south of the Dead Sea.

     * Gen. xi. 27-32. In the opinion of most critics, verses 27,
     31 32 form part of the document which was the basis of the
     various narratives still traceable in the Bible; it is
     thought that the remaining verses bear the marks of a later
     redaction, or that they may be additions of a later date.
     The most important part of the text, that relating the
     migration from Ur-Kashdîm to Kharân, belongs, therefore, to
     the very oldest part of the national tradition, and may be
     regarded as expressing the knowledge which the Hebrews of
     the times of the Kings possessed concerning the origin of
     their race.

     ** The most ancient interpretation identified this nameless
     river with the Euphrates; an identification still admitted
     by most critics; others prefer to recognise it as being the
     Jordan. Halévy prefers to identify it with one of the rivers
     of Damascus, probably the Abana.

      These peoples all traced their descent from Abraham, the son of Terakh,
      but the children of Israel claimed the privilege of being the only
      legitimate issue of his marriage with Sarah, giving naïve or derogatory
      accounts of the relations which connected the others with their common
      ancestor; Ammon and Moab were, for instance, the issue of the incestuous
      union of Lot and his daughters. Midian and his sons were descended from
      Keturah, who was merely a concubine, Ishmael was the son of an Egyptian
      slave, while the &ldquo;hairy&rdquo; Esau had sold his birthright and the primacy of
      the Edomites to his brother Jacob, and consequently to the Israelites, for
      a dish of lentils. Abraham left Kharân at the command of Jahveh, his God,
      receiving from Him a promise that his posterity should be blessed above
      all others. Abraham pursued his way into the heart of Canaan till he
      reached Shechem, and there, under the oaks of Moreh, Jahveh, appearing to
      him a second time, announced to him that He would give the whole land to
      his posterity as an inheritance. Abraham virtually took possession of it,
      and wandered over it with his flocks, building altars at Shechem, Bethel,
      and Mamre, the places where God had revealed Himself to him, treating as
      his equals the native chiefs, Abîmelech of Gerar and Melchizedek of
      Jerusalem,* and granting the valley of the Jordan as a place of pasturage
      to his nephew Lot, whose flocks had increased immensely.** His nomadic
      instinct having led him into Egypt, he was here robbed of his wife by
      Pharaoh.***

     the Elamites (<i>Gen</i>. xiv. 18-20) and the agreement with
     Abîmelech about the well (Gen. xxi. 22-34). The mention of
     the covenant of Abraham with Abîmelech belongs to the oldest
     part of the national tradition, and is given to us in the
     Jehovistic narrative. Many critics have questioned the
     historical existence of Melchizedek, and believed that the
     passage in which he is mentioned is merely a kind of parable
     intended to show the head of the race paying tithe of the
     spoil to the priest of the supreme God residing at
     Jerusalem; the information, however, furnished by the Tel-
     el-Amarna tablets about the ancient city of Jerusalem and
     the character of its early kings have determined Sayce to
     pronounce Melchizedek to be an historical personage.

     eponymous hero. Lôtan, which is the name of an Edomite clan,

      Abraham set out in pursuit of them, and succeeded in delivering his
      nephew.* God (Jahveh) not only favoured him on every occasion, but
      expressed His will to extend over Abraham&rsquo;s descendants His sheltering
      protection. He made a covenant with him, enjoining the use on the occasion
      of the mysterious rites employed among the nations when effecting a treaty
      of peace. Abraham offered up as victims a heifer, a goat, and a
      three-year-old ram, together with a turtle-dove and a young pigeon; he cut
      the animals into pieces, and piling them in two heaps, waited till the
      evening. &ldquo;And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham;
      and lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him,&rdquo; and a voice from on
      high said to him: &ldquo;Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
      land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them
      four hundred years; and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I

      came to pass, that when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a
      smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.&rdquo;
       Jahveh sealed the covenant by consuming the offering.

      Two less important figures fill the interval between the Divine prediction
      of servitude and its accomplishment. The birth of one of them, Isaac, was
      ascribed to the Divine intervention at a period when Sarah had given up
      all hope of becoming a mother. Abraham was sitting at his tent door in the
      heat of the day, when three men presented themselves before him, whom he
      invited to repose under the oak while he prepared to offer them
      hospitality. After their meal, he who seemed to be the chief of the three
      promised to return within a year, when Sarah should be blessed with the
      possession of a son. The announcement came from Jahveh, but Sarah was
      ignorant of the fact, and laughed to herself within the tent on hearing
      this amazing prediction; for she said, &ldquo;After I am waxed old shall I have
      pleasure, my lord being old also?&rdquo; The child was born, however, and was
      called Isaac, &ldquo;the laugher,&rdquo; in remembrance of Sarah&rsquo;s mocking laugh.*
      There is a remarkable resemblance between his life and that of his
      father.** Like Abraham he dwelt near Hebron,*** and departing thence
      wandered with his household round the wells of Beersheba. Like him he was
      threatened with the loss of his wife.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * <i>Gen</i>. xviii. 1-16, according to the Jehovistic narrative.
     <i>Gen</i>. xvii. 15-22 gives another account, in which the
     Elohistic writer predicts the birth of Isaac in a différent
     way. The name of Isaac, &ldquo;the laugher,&rdquo; possibly abridged
     from Isaak-el, &ldquo;he on whom God smiles,&rdquo; is explained in
     three different ways: first, by the laugh of Abraham (ch.
     xvii. 17); secondly, by that of Sarah (xviii. 12) when her
     son&rsquo;s birth was foretold to her; and lastly, by the laughter
     of those who made sport of the delayed maternity of Sarah
     (xxi. 6).

     ** Many critics see in the life of Isaac a colourless copy
     of that of Abraham, while others, on the contrary, consider
     that the primitive episodes belonged to the former, and that
     the parallel portions of the two lives were borrowed from
     the biography of the son to augment that of his father.

      Like him, also, he renewed relations with Abîmelech of Gerar.* He married
      his relative Rebecca, the granddaughter of Nâkhor and the sister of
      Laban.** After twenty years of barrenness, his wife gave birth to twins,
      Esau and Jacob, who contended with each other from their mother&rsquo;s womb,
      and whose descendants kept up a perpetual feud. We know how Esau, under
      the influence of his appetite, deprived himself of the privileges of his
      birthright, and subsequently went forth to become the founder of the
      Edomites. Jacob spent a portion of his youth in Padan-Aram; here he served
      Laban for the hands of his cousins Rachel and Leah; then, owing to the bad
      faith of his uncle, he left him secretly, after twenty years&rsquo; service,
      taking with him his wives and innumerable flocks. At first he wandered
      aimlessly along the eastern bank of the Jordan, where Jahveh revealed
      Himself to him in his troubles. Laban pursued and overtook him, and,
      acknowledging his own injustice, pardoned him for having taken flight.
      Jacob raised a heap of stones on the site of their encounter, known at
      Mizpah to after-ages as the &ldquo;Stone of Witness &ldquo;&mdash;G-al-Ed (Galeed).***
      This having been accomplished, his difficulties began with his brother
      Esau, who bore him no good will.

      One night, at the ford of the Jabbok, when he had fallen behind his
      companions, &ldquo;there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day,&rdquo;
       without prevailing against him. The stranger endeavoured to escape before
      daybreak, but only succeeded in doing so at the cost of giving Jacob his
      blessing. &ldquo;What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name
      shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God
      and with men, and hast prevailed.&rdquo; Jacob called the place Penîel, &ldquo;for,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.&rdquo; The
      hollow of his thigh was &ldquo;strained as he wrestled with him,&rdquo; and he became
      permanently lame.* Immediately after the struggle he met Esau, and
      endeavoured to appease him by his humility, building a house for him, and
      providing booths for his cattle, so as to secure for his descendants the
      possession of the land. From this circumstance the place received the name
      of Succôth&mdash;the &ldquo;Booths &ldquo;&mdash;by which appellation it was
      henceforth known. Another locality where Jahveh had met Jacob while he was
      pitching his tents, derived from this fact the designation of the &ldquo;Two
      Hosts&rdquo;&mdash;Mahanaîm.** On the other side of the river, at Shechem,*** at
      Bethel,**** and at Hebron, near to the burial-place of his family, traces
      of him are everywhere to be found blent with those of Abraham.

      By his two wives and their maids he had twelve sons. Leah was the mother
      of Keuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon; Gad. and Asher were
      the children of his slave Zilpah; while Joseph and Benjamin were the only
      sons of Rachel&mdash;Dan and Naphtali being the offspring of her servant
      Bilhah. The preference which his father showed to him caused Joseph to be
      hated by his brothers; they sold him to a caravan of Midianites on their
      way to Egypt, and persuaded Jacob that a wild beast had devoured him.
      Jahveh was, however, with Joseph, and &ldquo;made all that he did to prosper in
      his hand.&rdquo; He was bought by Potiphar, a great Egyptian lord and captain of
      Pharaoh&rsquo;s guard, who made him his overseer; his master&rsquo;s wife, however,
      &ldquo;cast her eyes upon Joseph,&rdquo; but finding that he rejected her shameless
      advances, she accused him of having offered violence to her person. Being
      cast into prison, he astonished his companions in misfortune by his skill
      in reading dreams, and was summoned to Court to interpret to the king his
      dream of the seven lean kine who had devoured the seven fat kine, which he
      did by representing the latter as seven years of abundance, of which the
      crops should be swallowed up by seven years of famine. Joseph was
      thereupon raised by Pharaoh to the rank of prime minister. He stored up
      the surplus of the abundant harvests, and as soon as the famine broke out,
      distributed the corn to the hunger-stricken people in exchange for their
      silver and gold, and for their flocks and fields. Hence it was,that the
      whole of the Nile valley, with the exception of the lands belonging to the
      priests, gradually passed into the possession of the royal treasury.
      Meanwhile his brethren, who also suffered from the famine, came down into
      Egypt to buy corn. Joseph revealed himself to them, pardoned the wrong
      they had done him, and presented them to the Pharaoh. &ldquo;And Pharaoh said
      unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go,
      get you unto the land of Canaan: and take your father and your household,
      and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and
      ye shall eat the fat of the land.&rdquo; Jacob thereupon raised his camp and
      came to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father
      Isaac; and Jahveh commanded him to go down into Egypt, saying, &ldquo;I will
      there make of thee a great nation: I will go down with thee into Egypt:
      and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand
      upon thine eyes.&rdquo; The whole family were installed by Pharaoh in the
      province of Goshen, as far as possible from the centres of the native
      population, &ldquo;for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.&rdquo;

      In the midst of these stern yet touching narratives in which the Hebrews
      of the times of the Kings delighted to trace the history of their remote
      ancestors, one important fact arrests our attention: the Beni-Israel
      quitted Southern Syria and settled on the banks of the Nile. They had
      remained for a considerable time in what was known later as the mountains
      of Judah. Hebron had served as their rallying-point; the broad but
      scantily watered wadys separating the cultivated lands from the desert,
      were to them a patrimony, which they shared with the inhabitants of the
      neighbouring towns. Every year, in the spring, they led their flocks to
      browse on the thin herbage growing in the bottoms of the valleys, removing
      them to another district only when the supply of fodder was exhausted. The
      women span, wove, fashioned garments, baked bread, cooked the viands, and
      devoted themselves to the care of the younger children, whom they suckled
      beyond the usual period. The men lived like the Bedouin&mdash;periods of
      activity alternating regularly with times of idleness, and the daily
      routine, with its simple duties and casual work, often gave place to
      quarrels for the possession of some rich pasturage or some never-failing
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      A comparatively ancient tradition relates that the Hebrews arrived in
      Egypt during the reign of Aphôbis, a Hyksôs king, doubtless one of the
      Apôpi, and possibly the monarch who restored the monuments of the Theban
      Pharaohs, and engraved his name on the sphinxes of Amenemhâît III. and on
      the colossi of Mîrmâshâû.* The land which the Hebrews obtained is that
      which, down to the present day, is most frequently visited by nomads, who
      find there an uncertain hospitality.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The year XVII. of Apôphis has been pointed out as the date
     of their arrival, and this combination, probably proposed by
     some learned Jew of Alexandria, was adopted by Christian
     chroniclers. It is unsupported by any fact of Egyptian
     history, but it rests on a series of calculations founded on
     the information contained in the Bible. Starting from the
     assumption that the Exodus must have taken place under
     Ahmosîs, and that the children of Israel had been four
     hundred and thirty years on the banks of the Nile, it was
     found that the beginning of their sojourn fell under the
     reign of the Apôphis mentioned by Josephus, and, to be still
     more correct, in the XVIIth year of that prince.

      The tribes of the isthmus of Suez are now, in fact, constantly shifting
      from one continent to another, and their encampments in any place are
      merely temporary. The lord of the soil must, if he desire to keep them
      within his borders, treat them with the greatest prudence and tact. Should
      the government displease them in any way, or appear to curtail their
      liberty, they pack up their tents and take flight into the desert. The
      district occupied by them one day is on the next vacated and left to
      desolation. Probably the same state of things existed in ancient times,
      and the border nomes on the east of the Delta were in turn inhabited or
      deserted by the Bedouin of the period. The towns were few in number, but a
      series of forts protected the frontier. These were mere
      village-strongholds perched on the summit of some eminence, and surrounded
      by a strip of cornland. Beyond the frontier extended a region of bare
      rock, or a wide plain saturated with the ill-regulated surplus water of
      the inundation. The land of Goshen was bounded by the cities of Heliopolis
      on the south, Bubastis on the west, and Tanis and Mendes on the north: the
      garrison at Avaris could easily keep watch over it and maintain order
      within it, while they could at the same time defend it from the incursions
      of the Monatiû and the Hîrû-Shâîtû.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Goshen comprised the provinces situated on the borders of
     the cultivable cornland, and watered by the infiltration of

     have included the imperfectly irrigated provinces which were
     covered with pools and reedy swamps after each inundation.

      The Beni-Israel throve in these surroundings so well adapted to their
      traditional tastes. Even if their subsequent importance as a nation has
      been over-estimated, they did not at least share the fate of many foreign
      tribes, who, when transplanted into Egypt, waned and died out, or, at the
      end of two or three generations, became merged in the native population.*
      In pursuing their calling as shepherds, almost within sight of the rich
      cities of the Nile valley, they never forsook the God of their fathers to
      bow down before the Enneads or Triads of Egypt; whether He was already
      known to them as Jahveh, or was worshipped under the collective name of
      Elohîm, they served Him with almost unbroken fidelity even in the presence
      of Râ and Osiris, of Phtah and Sûtkhû.

     * We are told that when the Hebrews left Ramses, they were
     &ldquo;about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
     children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and
     flocks and herds, even very much cattle&rdquo; (<i>Exod.</i> xii. 37,
     38).
</pre>
    <p>
      The Hyksôs conquest had not in any way modified the feudal system of the
      country. The Shepherd-kings must have inherited the royal domain just as
      they found it at the close of the XIVth dynasty, but doubtless the whole
      Delta, from Avaris to Sais, and from Memphis to Buto, was their personal
      appanage. Their direct authority probably extended no further south than
      the pyramids, and their supremacy over the fiefs of the Said was at best
      precarious. The turbulent lords who shared among them the possession of
      the valley had never lost their proud or rebellious spirit, and under the
      foreign as under the native Pharaohs regulated their obedience to their
      ruler by the energy he displayed, or by their regard for the resources at
      his disposal. Thebes had never completely lost the ascendency which it
      obtained over them at the fall of the Memphite dynasty. The accession of
      the Xoite dynasty, and the arrival of the Shepherd-kings, in relegating
      Thebes unceremoniously to a second rank, had not discouraged it, or
      lowered its royal prestige in its own eyes or in those of others: the
      lords of the south instinctively rallied around it, as around their
      natural citadel, and their resources, combined with its own, rendered it
      as formidable a power as that of the masters of the Delta. If we had
      fuller information as to the history of this period, we should doubtless
      see that the various Theban princes took occasion, as in the
      Heracleopolitan epoch, to pick a quarrel with their sovereign lord, and
      did not allow themselves to be discouraged by any check.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The length of time during which Egypt was subject to
     Asiatic rule is not fully known. Historians are agreed in
     recognizing the three epochs referred to in the narrative of
     Manetho as corresponding with (1) the conquest and the six
     first Hyksôs kings, including the XVth Theban dynasty; (2)
     the complete submission of Egypt to the XVIth foreign
     dynasty; (3) the war of independence during the XVIIth
     dynasty, which consisted of two parallel series of kings,
     the one Shepherds (Pharaohs), the other Thebans. There has
     been considerable discussion as to the duration of the
     oppression. The best solution is still that given by Erman,
     according to whom the XVth dynasty lasted 284, the XVIth
     234, and the XVIIth 143 years, or, in all, 661 years. The
     invasion must, therefore, have taken place about 2346 B.C.,
     or about the time when the Elamite power was at its highest.
     The advent of the XVIth dynasty would fall about 2062 B.C.,
     and the commencement of the war of independence between 1730
     and 1720 B.C.
</pre>
    <p>
      The period of hegemony attributed by the chronicles to the Hyksôs of the
      XVIth dynasty was not probably, as far as they were concerned, years of
      perfect tranquillity, or of undisputed authority. In inscribing their sole
      names on the lists, the compilers denoted merely the shorter or longer
      period during which their Theban vassals failed in their rebellious
      efforts, and did not dare to assume openly the title or ensigns of
      royalty. A certain Apôphis, probably the same who took the prsenomen of
      Aqnûnrî, was reigning at Tanis when the decisive revolt broke out, and
      Saqnûnrî Tiûâa I., who was the leader on the occasion, had no other title
      of authority over the provinces of the south than that of <i>hiqu,</i> or
      regent. We are unacquainted with the cause of the outbreak or with its
      sequel, and the Egyptians themselves seem to have been not much better
      informed on the subject than ourselves. They gave free flight to their
      fancy, and accommodated the details to their taste, not shrinking from the
      introduction of daring fictions into the account. A romance, which was
      very popular with the literati four or five hundred years later, asserted
      that the real cause of the war was a kind of religious quarrel. &ldquo;It
      happened that the land of Egypt belonged to the Fever-stricken, and, as
      there was no supreme king at that time, it happened then that King
      Saqnûnrî was regent of the city of the south, and that the Fever-stricken
      of the city of Râ were under the rule of Râ-Apôpi in Avaris. The Whole
      Land tribute to the latter in manufactured products, and the north did the
      same in all the good things of the Delta. Now, the King Râ-Apôpi took to
      himself Sûtkhû for lord, and he did not serve any other god in the Whole
      Land except Sûtkhû, and he built a temple of excellent and everlasting
      work at the gate of the King Râ-Apôpi, and he arose every morning to
      sacrifice the daily victims, and the chief vassals were there with
      garlands of flowers, as it was accustomed to be done for the temple of
      Phrâ-Harmâkhis.&rdquo; Having finished the temple, he thought of imposing upon
      the Thebans the cult of his god, but as he shrank from employing force in
      such a delicate matter, he had recourse to stratagem. He took counsel with
      his princes and generals, but they were unable to propose any plan. The
      college of diviners and scribes was more complaisant: &ldquo;Let a messenger go
      to the regent of the city of the South to tell him: The King Râ-Apôpi
      commands thee: &lsquo;That the hippopotami which are in the pool of the town are
      to be exterminated in the pool, in order that slumber may come to me by
      day and by night.&rsquo; He will not be able to reply good or bad, and thou
      shalt send him another messenger: The King Râ-Apôpi commands thee: &lsquo;If the
      chief of the South does not reply to my message, let him serve no longer
      any god but Sûtkhû. But if he replies to it, and will do that which I tell
      him to do, then I will impose nothing further upon him, and I will not in
      future bow before any other god of the Whole Land than Amonrâ, king of the
      gods!&rsquo;&rdquo; Another Pharaoh of popular romance, Nectanebo, possessed, at a
      much later date, mares which conceived at the neighing of the stallions of
      Babylon, and his friend Lycerus had a cat which went forth every night to
      wring the necks of the cocks of Memphis:* the hippopotami of the Theban
      lake, which troubled the rest of the King of Tanis, were evidently of
      close kin to these extraordinary animals.

</pre>
    <p>
      The sequel is unfortunately lost. We may assume, however, without much
      risk of error, that Saqnûnrî came forth safe and sound from the ordeal;
      that Apôpi was taken in his own trap, and saw himself driven to the dire
      extremity of giving up Sûtkhû for Amonrâ or of declaring war. He was
      likely to adopt the latter alternative, and the end of the manuscript
      would probably have related his defeat.

      Hostilities continued for a century and a half from the time when Saqnûnrî
      Tiûâa declared himself son of the Sun and king of the two Egypts. From the
      moment in which he surrounded his name with a cartouche, the princes of
      the Said threw in their lot with him, and the XVIIth dynasty had its
      beginning on the day of his proclamation. The strife at first was
      undecisive and without marked advantage to either side: at length the
      Pharaoh whom the Greek copyists of Manetho call Alisphragmouthosis,
      defeated the barbarians, drove them away from Memphis and from the western
      plains of the Delta, and shut them up in their entrenched camp at Avaris,
      between the Sebennytic branch of the Nile and the Wady Tumilât. The
      monuments bearing on this period of strife and misery are few in number,
      and it is a fortunate circumstance if some insignificant object tarns up
      which would elsewhere be passed over as unworthy of notice. One of the
      officials of Tiûâa I. has left us his writing palette, on which the
      cartouches of his master are incised with a rudeness baffling description.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have also information of a prince of the blood, a king&rsquo;s son, Tûaû, who
      accompanied this same Pharaoh in his expeditions; and the Gîzeh Museum is
      proud of having in its possession the i wooden sabre which this individual
      placed on the mummy of a certain Aqhorû, to enable him to defend himself
      against the monsters of the lower world. A second Saqnûnrî Tiûâa succeeded
      the first, and like him was buried in a little brick pyramid on the border
      of the Theban necropolis. At his death the series of rulers was broken,
      and we meet with several names which are difficult to classify&mdash;Sakhontinibrî,
      Sanakhtû-niri, Hotpûrî, Manhotpûrî, Eâhotpû.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hotpûrî and Manhotpûrî are both mentioned in the fragments
     of a fantastic story (copied during the XXth dynasty), bits
     of which are found in most European museums. In one of these
     fragments, preserved in the Louvre, mention is made of
     Hotpûrî&rsquo;s tomb, certainly situated at Thebes; we possess
     scarabs of this king, and Pétrie discovered at Coptos a
     fragment of a stele bearing his name and titles, and
     describing the works which he executed in the temples of the
     town. The XIVth year of Manhotpûrî is mentioned in a passage
     of the story as being the date of the death of a personage
     born under Hotpûrî. These two kings belong, as far as we are
     able to judge, to the middle of the XVIIth dynasty; I am
     inclined to place beside them the Pharaoh Nûbhotpûrî, of
     whom we possess a few rather coarse scarabs.

      As we proceed, however, information becomes more plentiful, and the list
      of reigns almost complete. The part which the princesses of older times
      played in the transmission of power had, from the XIIth dynasty downward,
      considerably increased in importance, and threatened to overshadow that of
      the princes. The question presents itself whether, during these centuries
      of perpetual warfare, there had not been a moment when, all the males of
      the family having perished, the women alone were left to perpetuate the
      solar race on the earth and to keep the succession unbroken. As soon as
      the veil over this period of history begins to be lifted, we distinguish
      among the personages emerging from the obscurity as many queens as kings
      presiding over the destinies of Egypt. The sons took precedence of the
      daughters when both were the offspring of a brother and sister born of the
      same parents, and when, consequently, they were of equal rank; but, on the
      other hand, the sons forfeited this equality when there was any
      inferiority in origin on the maternal side, and their prospect of
      succession to the throne diminished in proportion to their mother&rsquo;s
      remoteness from the line of Râ. In the latter case all their sisters, born
      of marriages which to us appear incestuous, took precedence of them, and
      the eldest daughter became the legitimate Pharaoh, who sat in the seat of
      Horus on the death of her father, or even occasionally during his
      lifetime. The prince whom she married governed for her, and discharged
      those royal duties which could be legally performed by a man only,&mdash;such
      as offering worship to the supreme gods, commanding the army, and
      administering justice; but his wife never ceased to be sovereign, and
      however small the intelligence or firmness of which she might be
      possessed, her husband was obliged to leave to her, at all events on
      certain occasions, the direction of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her death her children inherited the crown: their father had formally
      to invest the eldest of them with royal, authority in the room of the
      deceased, and with him he shared the externals, if not the reality, of
      power.* It is doubtful whether the third Saq-nûnrî Tiûâa known to us&mdash;he
      who added an epithet to his name, and was commonly known as Tiûâqni,
      &ldquo;Tiûâa the brave&rdquo; ** &mdash;united in his person all the requisites of a
      Pharaoh qualified to reign in his own right. However this may have been,
      at all events his wife, Queen Ahhotpû, possessed them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Thus we find Thûtmosis I. formally enthroning his daughter
     Hât-shopsîtû, towards the close of his reign.

     ** It would seem that the epithet Qeni ( = the brave, the
     robust) did not form an indispensable part of his name, any
     more than Ahmosi did of the names of members of the family
     of Ahmosis, the conqueror of the Shepherds. It is to him
     that the Tiûâa cartouche refers, which is to be found on the
     statue mentioned by Daninos-Pasha, published by Bouriant,
     and on which we find Ahmosis, a princess of the same name,
     together with Queen Ahhotpû I.
</pre>
    <p>
      His eldest son Ahmosû died prematurely; the two younger brothers, Kamosû
      and a second Ahmosû, the Amosis of the Greeks, assumed the crown after
      him. It is possible, as frequently happened, that their young sister
      Ahmasi-Nofrîtari entered the harem of both brothers consecutively.

      We cannot be sure that she was united to Kamosû, but at all events she
      became the wife of Ahmosis, and the rights which she possessed, together
      with those which her husband had inherited from their mother Ahhotpû, gave
      him a legal claim such as was seldom enjoyed by the Pharaohs of that
      period, so many of them being sovereigns merely <i>de facto,</i> while he
      was doubly king by right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiûâqni, Kamosû,* and Ahmosis** quickly succeeded each other. Tiûâqni very
      probably waged war against the Shepherds, and it is not known whether he
      fell upon the field of battle or was the victim of some plot; the
      appearance of his mummy proves that he died a violent death when about
      forty years of age. Two or three men, whether assassins or soldiers, must
      have surrounded and despatched him before help was available. A blow from
      an axe must have severed part of his left cheek, exposed the teeth,
      fractured the jaw, and sent him senseless to the ground; another blow must
      have seriously injured the skull, and a dagger or javelin has cut open the
      forehead on the right side, a little above the eye. His body must have
      remained lying where it fell for some time: when found, decomposition had
      set in, and the embalming had to be hastily performed as best it might.
      The hair is thick, rough, and matted; the face had been shaved on the
      morning of his death, but by touching the cheek we can ascertain how harsh
      and abundant the hair must have been. The mummy is that of a fine,
      vigorous man, who might have lived to a hundred years, and he must have
      defended himself resolutely against his assailants; his features bear even
      now an expression of fury. A flattened patch of exuded brain appears above
      one eye, the forehead is wrinkled, and the lips, which are drawn back in a
      circle about the gums, reveal the teeth still biting into the tongue.
      Kamosû did not reign long;&rsquo;we know nothing of the events of his life, but
      we owe to him one of the prettiest examples of the Egyptian goldsmith&rsquo;s
      art&mdash;the gold boat mounted on a carriage of wood and bronze, which
      was to convey his double on its journeys through Hades. This boat was
      afterwards appropriated by his mother Ahhotpû.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * With regard to Kamosû, we possess, in addition to the
     miniature bark which was discovered on the sarcophagus of
     Queen Ahhotpû, and which is now in the museum at Gîzeh, a
     few scattered references to his worship existing on the
     monuments, on a stele at Gîzeh, on a table of offerings in
     the Marseilles Museum, and in the list of princes worshipped
     by the &ldquo;servants of the Necropolis.&rdquo; His pyramid was at Drah-
     Abu&rsquo;l-Neggah, beside those of Ilûâa and Amenôthês I.

     ** The name Amosû or Ahmosi is usually translated &ldquo;Child of
     the Moon-god&rdquo; the real meaning is, &ldquo;the Moon-god has brought
     forth,&rdquo; &ldquo;him&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo; (referring to the person who bears
     the name) being understood.
</pre>
    <p>
      Ahmosisa must have been about twenty-five years of age when he ascended
      the throne; he was of medium height, as his body when mummied measured
      only 5 feet 6 inches in length, but the development of the neck and chest
      indicates extraordinary strength. The head is small in proportion to the
      bust, the forehead low and narrow, the cheek-bones project, and the hair
      is thick and wavy. The face exactly resembles that of Tiûâcrai, and the
      likeness alone would proclaim the affinity, even if we were ignorant of
      the close relationship which united these two Pharaohs.* Ahmosis seems to
      have been a strong, active, warlike man; he was successful in all the wars
      in which we know him to have been engaged, and he ousted the Shepherds
      from the last towns occupied by them. It is possible that modern writers
      have exaggerated the credit due to Ahmosis for expelling the Hyksôs. He
      found the task already half accomplished, and the warfare of his
      forefathers for at least a century must have prepared the way for his
      success; if he appears to have played the most important <i>rôle</i> in
      the history of the deliverance, it is owing to our ignorance of the work
      of others, and he thus benefits by the oblivion into which their deeds
      have passed. Taking this into consideration, we must still admit that the
      Shepherds, even when driven into Avaris, were not adversaries to be
      despised. Forced by the continual pressure of the Egyptian armies into
      this corner of the Delta, they were as a compact body the more able to
      make a protracted resistance against very superior forces.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Here again my description is taken from the present
     appearance of the mummy, which is now in the Gîzeh Museum.
     It is evident, from the inspection which I have made, that
     Ahmosis was about fifty years old at the time of his death,
     and, allowing him to have reigned twenty-five years, he must
     have been twenty-five or twenty-six when he came to the
     throne.

      The impenetrable marshes of Menzaleh on the north, and the desert of the
      Red Sea on the south, completely covered both their wings; the shifting
      network of the branches of the Nile, together with the artificial canals,
      protected them as by a series of moats in front, while Syria in their rear
      offered them inexhaustible resources for revictualling their troops, or
      levying recruits among tribes of kindred race. As long as they could hold
      their ground there, a re-invasion was always possible; one victory would
      bring them to Memphis, and the whole valley would again fall under
      then-suzerainty. Ahmosis, by driving them from their last stronghold,
      averted this danger. It is, therefore, not without reason that the
      official chroniclers of later times separated him from his ancestors and
      made him the head of a new dynasty.

      His predecessors had in reality been merely Pharaohs on sufferance, ruling
      in the south within the confines of their Theban principality, gaining in
      power, it is true, with every generation, but never able to attain to the
      suzerainty of the whole country. They were reckoned in the XVIIth dynasty
      together with the Hyksôs sovereigns of uncontested legitimacy, while their
      successors were chosen to constitute the XVIIIth, comprising Pharaohs with
      full powers, tolerating no competitors, and uniting under their firm rule
      the two regions of which Egypt was composed&mdash;the possessions of Sit
      and the possessions of Horus.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Manetho, or his abridgers, call the king who drove out the
     Shepherds Amôsis or Tethmôsis. Lepsius thought he saw
     grounds for preferring the second reading, and identified
     this Tethmôsis with Thûtmosi Manakhpirri, the ïhûtmosis III.
     of our lists; Ahmosis could only have driven out the greater
     part of the nation. This theory, to which Naville still
     adheres, as also does Stindorff, was disputed nearly fifty
     years ago by E. de Rougé; nowadays we are obliged to admit
     that, subsequent to the Vth year of Ahmosis, there were no
     longer Shepherd-kings in Egypt, even though a part of the
     conquering race may have remained in the country in a state
     of slavery, as we shall soon have occasion to observe.

      The war of deliverance broke out on the accession of Ahmosis, and
      continued during the first five years of his reign.* One of his
      lieutenants, the king&rsquo;s namesake&mdash;Âhmosi-si-Abîna&mdash;who belonged
      to the family of the lords of Nekhabît, has left us an account, in one of
      the inscriptions in his tomb, of the numerous exploits in which he took
      part side by side with his royal master, and thus, thanks to this
      fortunate record of his vanity, we are not left in complete ignorance of
      the events which took place during this crucial struggle between the
      Asiatic settlers and their former subjects. Nekhabît had enjoyed
      considerable prosperity in the earlier ages of Egyptian history, marking
      as it did the extreme southern limit of the kingdom, and forming an
      outpost against the barbarous tribes of Nubia. As soon as the progress of
      conquest had pushed the frontier as far south as the first cataract, it
      declined in importance, and the remembrance of its former greatness found
      an echo only in proverbial expressions or in titles used at the Pharaonic
      court.* The nomes situated to the south of Thebes, unlike those of Middle
      Egypt, did not comprise any extensive fertile or well-watered territory
      calculated to enrich its possessors or to afford sufficient support for a
      large population: they consisted of long strips of alluvial soil, shut in
      between the river and the mountain range, but above the level of the
      inundation, and consequently difficult to irrigate.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is evident from passage in the biography of Ahmosi-
     si-Abîna, where it is stated that, after the taking of
     Avaris, the king passed into Asia in the year VI. The first
     few lines of the <i>Great Inscription of El-Kab</i> seem to refer
     to four successive campaigns, i.e. four years of warfare up
     to the taking of Avaris, and to a fifth year spent in
     pursuing the Shepherds into Syria.

     ** The vulture of Nekhabît is used to indicate the south,
     while the urseus of Buto denotes the extreme north; the
     title Râ-Nekhnît, &ldquo;Chief of Nekhnît,&rdquo; which is,
     hypothetically, supposed to refer to a judicial function, is
     none the less associated with the expression, &ldquo;Nekhabît-
     Tekhnît,&rdquo; as an indication of the south, and, therefore,
     can be traced to the prehistoric epoch when Nekhabît was the
     primary designation of the south.

      These nomes were cultivated, moreover, by a poor and sparse population. It
      needed a fortuitous combination of circumstances to relieve them from
      their poverty-stricken condition&mdash;either a war, which would bring
      into prominence their strategic positions; or the establishment of
      markets, such as those of Syênê and Elephantine, where the commerce of
      neighbouring regions would naturally centre; or the erection, as at Ombos
      or Adfû, of a temple which would periodically attract a crowd of pilgrims.
      The principality of the Two Feathers comprised, besides Nekhabît, ât least
      two such towns&mdash;Anît, on its northern boundary, and Nekhnît almost
      facing Nekhabît on the left bank of the river.* These three towns
      sometimes formed separate estates for as many independent lords:** even
      when united they constituted a fiefdom of but restricted area and of
      slender revenues, its chiefs ranking below those of the great feudal
      princes of Middle Egypt. The rulers of this fiefdom led an obscure
      existence during the whole period of the Memphite empire, and when at
      length Thebes gained the ascendency, they rallied to the latter and
      acknowledged her suzerainty. One of them, Sovkûnakhîti, gained the favour
      of Sovkhotpû III. Sakhemûaztaûirî, who granted him lands which made the
      fortune of his house; another of them, Aï, married Khonsu, one of the
      daughters of Sovkûmsaûf I. and his Queen Nûbkhâs, and it is possible that
      the misshapen pyramid of Qûlah, the most southern in Egypt proper, was
      built for one of these royally connected personages.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Nekhnît is the Hieracônpolis of Greek and Roman times,
     Hâît-Baûkû, the modern name of which is Kom-el-Ahmar.

     ** Pihiri was, therefore, prince of Nekhabît and of Anît at
     one and the same time, whereas the town of Nekhnît had its
     own special rulers, several of whom are known to us from the
     tombs at Kom-el-Ahmar.
</pre>
    <p>
      The descendants of Aï attached themselves faithfully to the Pharaohs of
      the XVIIth dynasty, and helped them to the utmost in their struggle
      against the invaders. Their capital, Nekhabît, was situated between the
      Nile and the Arabian chain, at the entrance to a valley which penetrates
      some distance into the desert, and leads to the gold-mines on the Red Sea.
      The town profited considerably from the precious metals brought into it by
      the caravans, and also from the extraction of natron, which from
      prehistoric times was largely employed in embalming. It had been a
      fortified place from the outset, and its walls, carefully repaired by
      successive ages, were still intact at the beginning of this century. They
      described at this time a rough quadrilateral, the two longer sides of
      which measured some 1900 feet in length, the two shorter being about
      one-fourth less. The southern face was constructed in a fashion common in
      brick buildings in Egypt, being divided into alternate panels of
      horizontally laid courses, and those in which the courses were concave; on
      the north and west façades the bricks were so laid as to present an
      undulating arrangement running uninterruptedly from one end to the other.
      The walls are 33 feet thick, and their average height 27 feet; broad and
      easy steps lead to the foot-walk on the top. The gates are unsymmetrically
      placed, there being one on the north, east, and west sides respectively;
      while the southern side is left without an opening. These walls afforded
      protection to a dense but unequally distributed population, the bulk of
      which was housed towards the north and west sides, where the remains of an
      immense number of dwellings may still be seen. The temples were crowded
      together in a small square enclosure, concentric with the walls of the
      enceinte, and the principal sanctuary was dedicated to Nekhabît, the
      vulture goddess, who gave her name to the city.* This enclosure formed a
      kind of citadel, where the garrison could hold out when the outer part had
      fallen into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. The times were troublous; the open country
      was repeatedly wasted by war, and the peasantry had more than once to seek
      shelter behind the protecting ramparts of the town, leaving their lands to
      lie fallow.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A part of the latter temple, that which had been rebuilt
     in the Saîte epoch, was still standing at the beginning of
     the XIXth century, with columns bearing the cartouches of
     Hakori; it was destroyed about the year 1825, and
     Champollion found only the foundations of the walls.

      Famine constantly resulted from these disturbances, and it taxed all the
      powers of the ruling prince to provide at such times for his people. A
      chief of the Commissariat, Bebî by name, who lived about this period,
      gives us a lengthy account of the number of loaves, oxen, goats, and pigs,
      which he allowed to all the inhabitants both great and little, down even
      to the quantity of oil and incense, which he had taken care to store up
      for them: his prudence was always justified by the issue, for &ldquo;during the
      many years in which the famine recurred, he distributed grain in the city
      to all those who hungered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babaî, the first of the lords of El-Kab whose name has come down to us,
      was a captain in the service of Saqnûnrî Tiûâqni.* His son Ahmosi, having
      approached the end of his career, cut a tomb for himself in the hill which
      overlooks the northern side of the town. He relates on the walls of his
      sepulchre, for the benefit of posterity, the most praiseworthy actions of
      his long life. He had scarcely emerged from childhood when he was called
      upon to act for his father, and before his marriage he was appointed to
      the command of the barque <i>The Calf.</i> From thence he was promoted to
      the ship <i>The North</i>, and on account of his activity he was chosen to
      escort his namesake the king on foot, whenever he drove in his chariot. He
      repaired to his post at the moment when the decisive war against the
      Hyksôs broke out.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * There are still some doubts as to the descent of this
     Ahmosi. Some authorities hold that Babai was the name of his
     father and Abîna that of his grandfather; others think that
     Babai was his father and Abîna his mother; others, again,
     make out Babai and Abîna to be variants of the same name,
     probably a Semitic one, borne by the father of Ahmosi; the
     majority of modern Egyptologists (including myself) regard
     this last hypothesis as being the most probable one.
</pre>
    <p>
      The tradition current in the time of the Ptolemies reckoned the number of
      men under the command of King Ahmosis when he encamped before Avaris at
      480,000. This immense multitude failed to bring matters to a successful
      issue, and the siege dragged on indefinitely. The king afc length
      preferred to treat with the Shepherds, and gave them permission to retreat
      into Syria safe and sound, together with their wives, their children, and
      all their goods. This account, however, in no way agrees with the all too
      brief narration of events furnished by the inscription in the tomb. The
      army to which Egypt really owed its deliverance was not the undisciplined
      rabble of later tradition, but, on the contrary, consisted of troops
      similar to those which subsequently invaded Syria, some 15,000 to 20,000
      in number, fully equipped and ably officered, supported, moreover, by a
      fleet ready to transfer them across the canals and arms of the river in a
      vigorous condition and ready for the battle.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It may be pointed out that Ahmosi, son of Abîna, was a
     sailor and a leader of sailors; that he passed from one
     vessel to another, until he was at length appointed to the
     command of one of the most important ships in the royal
     fleet. Transport by water always played considerable part in
     the wars which were carried on in Egyptian territory; I have
     elsewhere drawn attention to campaigns conducted in this
     manner under the Horacleopolitan dynasties, and we shall see
     that the Ethiopian conquerors adopted the same mode of
     transit in the course of their invasion of Egypt.
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as this fleet arrived at the scene of hostilities, the engagement
      began. Ahmosi-si-Abîna conducted the manouvres under the king&rsquo;s eye, and
      soon gave such evidence of his capacity, that he was transferred by royal
      favour to the <i>Rising in Memphis</i>&mdash;a vessel with a high
      freeboard. He was shortly afterwards appointed to a post in a division
      told off for duty on the river Zadiku, which ran under the walls of the
      enemy&rsquo;s fortress.* Two successive and vigorous attacks made in this
      quarter were barren of important results. Ahmosi-si-Abîna succeeded in
      each of the attacks in killing an enemy, bringing back as trophies a hand
      of each of his victims, and his prowess, made known to the king by one of
      the heralds, twice procured for him, &ldquo;the gold of valour,&rdquo; probably in the
      form of collars, chains, or bracelets.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name of this canal was first recognised by Brugsch,
     then misunderstood and translated &ldquo;the water bearing the
     name of the water of Avaris.&rdquo; It is now road &ldquo;Zadikû,&rdquo; and,
     with the Egyptian article, Pa-zadikû, or Pzadikû. The name
     is of Semitic origin, and is derived from the root meaning
     &ldquo;to be just;&rdquo; we do not know to which of the watercourses
     traversing the east of the Delta it ought to be applied.

     ** The fact that the attacks from this side were not
     successful is proved by the sequel. If they had succeeded,
     as is usually supposed, the Egyptians would not have fallen
     back on another point further south in order to renew the
     struggle.

      The assault having been repulsed in this quarter, the Egyptians made their
      way towards the south, and came into conflict with the enemy at the
      village of Taqimît.* Here, again, the battle remained undecided, but
      Ahmosi-si-Abîna had an adventure. He had taken a prisoner, and in bringing
      him back lost himself, fell into a muddy ditch, and, when he had freed
      himself from the dirt as well as he could, pursued his way by mistake for
      some time in the direction of Avaris. He found out his error, however,
      before it was too late, came back to the camp safe and sound, and received
      once more some gold as a reward of his brave conduct. A second attack upon
      the town was crowned with complete success; it was taken by storm, given
      over to pillage, and Ahmosi-si-Abîna succeeded in capturing one man and
      three women, who were afterwards, at the distribution of the spoil, given
      to him as slaves.** The enemy evacuated in haste the last strongholds
      which they held in the east of the Delta, and took refuge in the Syrian
      provinces on the Egyptian frontier. Whether it was that they assumed here
      a menacing attitude, or whether Ahmosis hoped to deal them a crushing blow
      before they could find time to breathe, or to rally around them sufficient
      forces to renew the offensive, he made up his mind to cross the frontier,
      which he did in the 5th year of his reign.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The site of Taqimît is unknown.

     ** The prisoner who was given to Ahmosis after the victory,
     is probably Paâmû, the Asiatic, mentioned in the list of his
     slaves which he had engraved on one of the walls of his
     tomb.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was the first time for centuries that a Pharaoh had trusted himself in
      Asia, and the same dread of the unknown which had restrained his ancestors
      of the XIIth dynasty, doubtless arrested Ahmosis also on the threshold of
      the continent. He did not penetrate further than the border provinces of
      Zahi, situated on the edge of the desert, and contented himself with
      pillaging the little town of Sharûhana.* Ahmosi-si-Abîna was again his
      companion, together with his cousin, Ahmosi-Pannekhabit, then at the
      beginning of his career, who brought away on this occasion two young girls
      for his household.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sharûhana, which is mentioned again under Thûtmosis III.
     is not the plain of Sharon, as Birch imagined, but the
     Sharuhen of the Biblical texts, in the tribe of Simeon
     (<i>Josh.</i> xix. 6), as Brugsch recognised it to be. It is
     probably identical with the modern Tell-esh-Sheriâh, which
     lies north-west of Beersheba.

     ** Ahmosi Pannekhabit lay in tomb No. 2, at El-Kab. His
     history is briefly told on one of the walls, and on two
     sides of the pedestal of his statues. We have one of these,
     or rather two plates from the pedestal of one of them, in
     the Louvre; the other is in a good state of preservation,
     and belongs to Mr. Finlay. The inscription is found in a
     mutilated condition on the wall of the tomb, but the three
     monuments which have come down to us are sufficiently
     complementary to one another to enable us to restore nearly
     the whole of the original text.
</pre>
    <p>
      The expedition having accomplished its purpose, the Egyptians returned
      home with their spoil, and did not revisit Asia for a long period. If the
      Hyksôs generals had fostered in their minds the idea that they could
      recover their lost ground, and easily re-enter upon the possession of
      their African domain, this reverse must have cruelly disillusioned them.
      They must have been forced to acknowledge that their power was at an end,
      and to renounce all hope of returning to the country which had so
      summarily ejected them. The majority of their own people did not follow
      them into exile, but remained attached to the soil on which they lived,
      and the tribes which had successively settled down beside them&mdash;including
      the Beni-Israel themselves&mdash;no longer dreamed of a return to their
      fatherland. The condition of these people varied according to their
      locality. Those who had taken up a position in the plain of the Delta were
      subjected to actual slavery. Ahmosis destroyed the camp at Avails,
      quartered his officers in the towns, and constructed forts at strategic
      points, or rebuilt the ancient citadels to resist the incursions of the
      Bedouin. The vanquished people in the Delta, hemmed in as they were by a
      network of fortresses, were thus reduced to a rabble of serfs, to be taxed
      and subjected to the <i>corvée</i> without mercy. But further north, the
      fluctuating population which roamed between the Sebennytic and Pelusiac
      branches of the Nile were not exposed to such rough treatment. The marshes
      of the coast-line afforded them a safe retreat, in which they could take
      refuge at the first threat of exactions on the part of the royal
      emissaries. Secure within dense thickets, upon islands approached by
      interminable causeways, often covered with water, or by long tortuous
      canals concealed in the thick growth of reeds, they were able to defy with
      impunity the efforts of the most disciplined troops, and treason alone
      could put them at the mercy of their foes. Most of the Pharaohs felt that
      the advantages to be gained by conquering them would be outweighed by the
      difficulty of the enterprise; all that could result from a campaign would
      be the destruction of one or two villages, the acquisition of a few
      hundred refractory captives, of some ill-favoured cattle, and a trophy of
      nets and worm-eaten boats. The kings, therefore, preferred to keep a close
      watch over these undisciplined hordes, and as long as their depredations
      were kept within reasonable limits, they were left unmolested to their
      wild and precarious life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Asiatic invasion had put a sudden stop to the advance of Egyptian rule
      in the vast plains of the Upper Nile. The Theban princes, to whom Nubia
      was directly subject, had been too completely engrossed in the wars
      against their hereditary enemy, to devote much time to the continuation of
      that work of colonization in the south which had been carried on so
      vigorously by their forefathers of the XIIth and XIIIth dynasties. The
      inhabitants of the Nile valley, as far as the second cataract, rendered
      them obedience, but without any change in the conditions and mode of their
      daily life, which appear to have remained unaltered for centuries. The
      temples of Usirtasen and Amenemhaît were allowed to fall into decay one
      after another, the towns waned in prosperity, and were unable to keep
      their buildings and monuments in repair; the inundation continued to bring
      with it periodically its fleet of boats, which the sailors of Kûsh had
      laden with timber, gum, elephants&rsquo; tusks, and gold dust: from time to time
      a band of Bedouin from Uaûaît or Mazaiû would suddenly bear down upon some
      village and carry off its spoils; the nearest garrison would be called to
      its aid, or, on critical occasions, the king himself, at the head of his
      guards, would fall on the marauders and drive them back into the
      mountains. Ahrnosis, being greeted on his return from Syria by the news of
      such an outbreak, thought it a favourable moment to impress upon the
      nomadic tribes of Nubia the greatness of his conquest. On this occasion it
      was the people of Khonthanûnofir, settled in the wadys east of the Nile,
      above Semneh, which required a lesson. The army which had just expelled
      the Hyksôs was rapidly conveyed to the opposite borders of the country by
      the fleet, the two Ahmosi of Nekhabît occupying the highest posts. The
      Egyptians, as was customary, landed at the nearest point to the enemy&rsquo;s
      territory, and succeeded in killing a few of the rebels. Ahmosi-si-Abîna
      brought back two prisoners and three hands, for which he was rewarded by a
      gift of two female Bedouin slaves, besides the &ldquo;gold of valour.&rdquo; This
      victory in the south following on such decisive success in the north,
      filled the heart of the Pharaoh with pride, and the view taken of it by
      those who surrounded him is evident even in the brief sentences of the
      narrative. He is described as descending the river on the royal galley,
      elated in spirit and flushed by his triumph in Nubia, which had followed
      so closely on the deliverance of the Delta. But scarcely had he reached
      Thebes, when an unforeseen catastrophe turned his confidence into alarm,
      and compelled him to retrace his steps. It would appear that at the very
      moment when he was priding himself on the successful issue of his
      Ethiopian expedition, one of the sudden outbreaks, which frequently
      occurred in those regions, had culminated in a Sudanese invasion of Egypt.
      We are not told the name of the rebel leader, nor those of the tribes who
      took part in it. The Egyptian people, threatened in a moment of such
      apparent security by this inroad of barbarians, regarded them as a fresh
      incursion of the Hyksôs, and applied to these southerners the opprobrious
      term of &ldquo;Fever-stricken,&rdquo; already used to denote their Asiatic conquerors.
      The enemy descended the Nile, committing terrible atrocities, and
      polluting every sanctuary of the Theban gods which came within their
      reach. They had reached a spot called Tentoâ,* before they fell in with
      the Egyptian troops. Ahmosi-si-Abîna again distinguished himself in the
      engagement. The vessel which he commanded, probably the <i>Rising in
      Memphis</i>, ran alongside the chief galliot of the Sudanese fleet, and
      took possession of it after a struggle, in which Ahmosi made two of the
      enemy&rsquo;s sailors prisoners with his own hand. The king generously rewarded
      those whose valour had thus turned the day in his favour, for the danger
      had appeared to him critical; he allotted to every man on board the
      victorious vessel five slaves, and five ancra of land situated in his
      native province of each respectively. The invasion was not without its
      natural consequences to Egypt itself.

     canal, or the branch of a river, or a harbour somewhere
     along the Nile. I am unable to locate it definitely, but am
     inclined to think we ought to look for it, if not in Egypt
     itself, at any rate in that part of Nubia which is nearest
     to Egypt. M. Revillout, taking up a theory which had been
     abandoned by Chabas, recognising in this expedition an
     offensive incursion of the Shepherds, suggests that Tantoâ
     may be the modern Tantah in the Delta.

      A certain Titiânu, who appears to have been at the head of a powerful
      faction, rose in rebellion at some place not named in the narrative, but
      in the rear of the army. The rapidity with which Ahmosis repulsed the
      Nubians, and turned upon his new enemy, completely baffled the latter&rsquo;s
      plans, and he and his followers were cut to pieces, but the danger had for
      the moment been serious.* It was, if not the last expedition undertaken in
      this reign, at least the last commanded by the Pharaoh in person. By his
      activity and courage Ahmosis had well earned the right to pass the
      remainder of his days in peace.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The wording of the text is so much condensed that it is
     difficult to be sure of its moaning. Modern scholars agree
     with Brugsch that Titiânu is the name of a man, but several
     Egyptologists believe its bearer to have been chief of the
     Ethiopian tribes, while others think him to have been a
     rebellious Egyptian prince, or a king of the Shepherds, or
     give up the task of identification in despair. The tortuous
     wording of the text, and the expressions which occur in it,
     seem to indicate that the rebel was a prince of the royal
     blood, and even that the name he bears was not his real one.
     Later on we shall find that, on a similar occasion, the
     official documents refer to a prince who took part in a plot
     against Ramses III. by the fictitious name of Pentauîrît;
     Titiânu was probably a nickname of the same kind inserted in
     place of the real name. It seems that, in cases of high
     treason, the criminal not only lost his life, but his name
     was proscribed both in this world and in the next.

      A revival of military greatness always entailed a renaissance in art,
      followed by an age of building activity. The claims of the gods upon the
      spoils of war must be satisfied before those of men, because the victory
      and the booty obtained through it were alike owing to the divine help
      given in battle. A tenth, therefore, of the slaves, cattle, and precious
      metals was set apart for the service of the gods, and even fields, towns,
      and provinces were allotted to them, the produce of which was applied to
      enhance the importance of their cult or to repair and enlarge their
      temples. The main body of the building was strengthened, halls and pylons
      were added to the original plan, and the impulse once given to
      architectural work, the co-operation of other artificers soon followed.
      Sculptors and painters whose art had been at a standstill for generations
      during the centuries of Egypt&rsquo;s humiliation, and whose hands had lost
      their cunning for want of practice, were now once more in demand. They had
      probably never completely lost the technical knowledge of their calling,
      and the ancient buildings furnished them with various types of models,
      which they had but to copy faithfully in order to revive their old
      traditions. A few years after this revival a new school sprang up, whose
      originality became daily more patent, and whose leaders soon showed
      themselves to be in no way inferior to the masters of the older schools.
      Ahmosis could not be accused of ingratitude to the gods; as soon as his
      wars allowed him the necessary leisure, he began his work of
      temple-building. The accession to power of the great Theban families had
      been of little advantage to Thebes itself. Its Pharaohs, on assuming the
      sovereignty of the whole valley, had not hesitated to abandon their native
      city, and had made Heracleopolis, the Fayum or even Memphis, their seat of
      government, only returning to Thebes in the time of the XIIIth dynasty,
      when the decadence of their power had set in. The honour of furnishing
      rulers for its country had often devolved on Thebes, but the city had
      reaped but little benefit from the fact; this time, however, the tide of
      fortune was to be turned. The other cities of Egypt had come to regard
      Thebes as their metropolis from the time when they had temples. The main
      body of the building was strengthened, halls and pylons were added to the
      original plan, and the impulse once given to architectural work, the

      The other cities of Egypt had come to regard Thebes as their metropolis
      from the time when they had learned to rally round its princes to wage war
      against the Hyksôs. It had been the last town to lay down arms at the time
      of the invasion, and the first to take them up again in the struggle for
      liberty. Thus the Egypt which vindicated her position among the nations of
      the world was not the Egypt of the Memphite dynasties. It was the great
      Egypt of the Amenemhâîts and the Usirtasens, still further aggrandised by
      recent victories. Thebes was her natural capital, and its kings could not
      have chosen a more suitable position from whence to command effectually
      the whole empire. Situated at an equal distance from both frontiers, the
      Pharaoh residing there, on the outbreak of a war either in the north or
      south, had but half the length of the country to traverse in order to
      reach the scene of action. Ahmosis spared no pains to improve the city,
      but his resources did not allow of his embarking on any very extensive
      schemes; he did not touch the temple of Amon, and if he undertook any
      buildings in its neighbourhood, they must have been minor edifices. He
      could, indeed, have had but little leisure to attempt much else, for it
      was not till the XXIInd year of his reign that he was able to set
      seriously to work.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the inscription of the year XXII., Âhmosis expressly
     states that he opened new chambers in the quarries of Tûrah
     for the works in connection with the Theban Amon, as well as
     for those of the temple of the Memphite Phtah.
</pre>
    <p>
      An opportunity then occurred to revive a practice long fallen into disuse
      under the foreign kings, and to set once more in motion an essential part
      of the machinery of Egyptian administration. The quarries of Turah, as is
      well known, enjoyed the privilege of furnishing the finest materials to
      the royal architects; nowhere else could be found limestone of such
      whiteness, so easy to cut, or so calculated to lend itself to the carving
      of delicate inscriptions and bas-reliefs. The commoner veins had never
      ceased to be worked by private enterprise, gangs of quarrymen being always
      employed, as at the present day, in cutting small stone for building
      purposes, or in ruthlessly chipping it to pieces to burn for lime in the
      kilns of the neighbouring villages; but the finest veins were always kept
      for State purposes. Contemporary chroniclers might have formed a very just
      estimate of national prosperity by the degree of activity shown in working
      these royal preserves; when the amount of stone extracted was lessened,
      prosperity was on the wane, and might be pronounced to be at its lowest
      ebb when the noise of the quarryman&rsquo;s hammer finally ceased to be heard.

      Every dynasty whose resources were such as to justify their resumption of
      the work proudly recorded the fact on stelae which lined the approaches to
      the masons&rsquo; yards. Ahmosis reopened the Tûrah quarry-chambers, and
      procured for himself &ldquo;good stone and white&rdquo; for the temples of Anion at
      Thebes and of Phtah at Memphis. No monument has as yet been discovered to
      throw any light on the fate of Memphis subsequent to the time of the
      Amenemhâîts. It must have suffered quite as much as any city of the Delta
      from the Shepherd invasion, and from the wars which preceded their
      expulsion, since it was situated on the highway of an invading army, and
      would offer an attraction for pillagers. By a curious turn of fortune it
      was the &ldquo;Fankhûi,&rdquo; or Asiatic prisoners, who were set to quarry the stone
      for the restoration of the monuments which their own forefathers had
      reduced to ruins.* The bas-reliefs sculptured on the stelæ of Ahmosis show
      them in full activity under the <i>corvée;</i> we see here the stone block
      detached from the quarry being squared by the chisel, or transported on a
      sledge drawn by oxen.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The <i>Fankhûi</i> are, properly speaking, all white prisoners,
     without distinction of race. Their name is derived from the
     root <i>fôkhu, fankhu</i> = to bind, press, carry off, steal,
     destroy; if it is sometimes used in the sense of
     Phoenicians, it is only in the Ptolemaic epoch. Here the
     term &ldquo;Fankhûi&rdquo; refers to the Shepherds and Asiatics made
     prisoners in the campaign of the year V. against Sharuhana.

      Ahmosis had several children by his various wives; six at least owned
      Nofrîtari for their mother and possessed near claims to the crown, but she
      may have borne him others whose existence is unrecorded. The eldest
      appears to have been a son, Sipiri; he received all the honours due to an
      hereditary prince, but died without having reigned, and his second
      brother, Amenhotpû&mdash;called by the Greeks Amenôthes*&mdash;took his
      place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The form Amenôphis, which is usually employed, is,
     properly speaking, the equivalent of the name
     <i>Amenemaupitu,</i> or Amenaupîti, which belongs to a king of
     the XXIst Tanite dynasty; the true Greek transcription of
     the Ptolemaic epoch, corresponding to the pronunciation
     <i>Amehotpe,</i> or <i>Amenhopte,</i> is Amenôthes. Under the XVIIIth
     dynasty the cuneiform transcription of the tablets of Tel-el
     Amarna, Amankhatbi, seems to indicate the pronunciation
     Amanhautpi, Amanhatpi, side by side with the pronunciation
     Aman-hautpu, Amenhotpu.

    <p>
      Ahmosis was laid to rest in the chapel which he had prepared for himself
      in the cemetery of Drah-abu&rsquo;l-Neggah, among the modest pyramids of the
      XIth, XIIIth, and XVIIth dynasties.* He was venerated as a god, and his
      cult was continued for six or eight centuries later, until the increasing
      insecurity of the Theban necropolis at last necessitated the removal of
      the kings from their funeral chambers.** The coffin of Ahmosis was found
      to be still intact, though it was a poorly made one, shaped to the
      contours of the body, and smeared over with yellow; it represents the king
      with the false beard depending from his chin, and his breast covered with
      a pectoral ornament, the features, hair, and accessories being picked out
      in blue. His name has been hastily inscribed in ink on the front of the
      winding-sheet, and when the lid was removed, garlands of faded pink
      flowers were still found about the neck, laid there as a last offering by
      the priests who placed the Pharaoh and his compeers in their secret
      burying-place.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The precise site is at present unknown: we see, however,
     that it was in this place, when wo observe that Ahmosis was
     worshipped by the Servants of the Necropolis, amongst the
     kings and princes of his family who were buried at Drah-
     abu&rsquo;l-Neggah.

     ** His priests and the minor <i>employés</i> of his cult are
     mentioned on a stele in the museum at Turin, and on a brick
     in the Berlin Museum. He is worshipped as a god, along with
     Osiris, Horus, and Isis, on a stele in the Lyons Museum,
     brought from Abydos: he had, probably, during one of his
     journeys across Egypt, made a donation to the temple of that
     city, on condition that he should be worshipped there for
     ever; for a stele at Marseilles shows him offering homage to
     Osiris in the bark of the god itself, and another stele in
     the Louvre informs us that Pharaoh Thûtmosis IV. several
     times sent one of his messengers to Abydos for the purpose
     of presenting land to Osiris and to his own ancestor
     Ahmosis.

      Amenôthes I. had not attained his majority when his father &ldquo;thus winged
      his way to heaven,&rdquo; leaving him as heir to the throne.* Nofrîtari assumed
      the authority; after having shared the royal honours for nearly
      twenty-five years with her husband, she resolutely refused to resign
      them.** She was thus the first of those queens by divine right who,
      scorning the inaction of the harem, took on themselves the right to fulfil
      the active duties of a sovereign, and claimed the recognition of the
      equality or superiority of their titles to those of their husbands or
      sons.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The last date known is that of the year XXII. at Tûrah;
     Manetho&rsquo;s lists give, in one place, twenty-five years and
     four months after the expulsion; in another, twenty-six
     years in round numbers, as the total duration of his reign,
     which has every appearance of probability.

     ** There is no direct evidence to prove that Amenôthes I.
     was a minor when he came to the throne; still the
     presumptions in favour of this hypothesis, afforded by the
     monuments, are so strong that many historians of ancient
     Egypt have accepted it. Queen Nofrîtari is represented as

     Theban tombs which can be attributed to their epoch.

      The aged Ahhotpu, who, like Nofrîtari, was of pure royal descent, and who
      might well have urged her superior rank, had been content to retire in
      favour of her children; she lived to the tenth year of her grandson&rsquo;s
      reign, respected by all her family, but abstaining from all interference
      in political affairs. When at length she passed away, full of days and
      honour, she was embalmed with special care, and her body was placed in a
      gilded mummy-case, the head of which presented a faithful copy of her
      features. Beside her were piled the jewels she had received in her
      lifetime from her husband and son. The majority of them a fan with a
      handle plated with gold, a mirror of gilt bronze with ebony handle,
      bracelets and ankle-rings, some of solid and some of hollow gold, edged
      with fine chains of plaited gold wire, others formed of beads of gold,
      lapis-lazuli, cornelian, and green felspar, many of them engraved with the
      cartouche of Ahmosis. Belonging also to Ahmosis we have a beautiful
      quiver, in which figures of the king and the gods stand out in high relief
      on a gold plaque, delicately chased with a graving tool; the background is
      formed of small pieces of lapis and blue glass, cunningly cut to fit each
      other. One bracelet in particular, found on the queen&rsquo;s wrist, consisted
      of three parallel bands of solid gold set with turquoises, and having, a
      vulture with extended wings on the front. The queen&rsquo;s hair was held in
      place by a gold circlet, scarcely as large as a bracelet; a cartouche was
      affixed to the circlet, bearing the name of Ahmosis in blue paste, and
      flanked by small sphinxes, one on each side, as supporters. A thick
      flexible chain of gold was passed several times round her neck, and
      attached to it as a pendant was a beautiful scarab, partly of gold and
      partly of blue porcelain striped with gold. The breast ornament was
      completed by a necklace of several rows of twisted cords, from which
      depended antelopes pursued by tigers, sitting jackals, hawks, vultures,
      and the winged urasus, all attached to the winding-sheet by means of a
      small ring soldered on the back of each animal. The fastening of this
      necklace was formed of the heads of two gold hawks, the details of the
      heads being worked out in blue enamel. Both weapons and amulets were found
      among the jewels, including three gold flies suspended by a thin chain,
      nine gold and silver axes, a lion&rsquo;s head in gold of most minute
      workmanship, a sceptre of black wood plated with gold, daggers to defend
      the deceased from the dangers of the unseen world, boomerangs of hard
      wood, and the battle-axe of Ahmosis. Besides these, there were two boats,
      one of gold and one of silver, originally intended for the Pharaoh Kamosû&mdash;models
      of the skiff in which his mummy crossed the Nile to reach its last
      resting-place, and to sail in the wake of the gods on the western sea.

      Nofrîtari thus reigned conjointly with Amenôthes, and even if we have no
      record of any act in which she was specially concerned, we know at least
      that her rule was a prosperous one, and that her memory was revered by her
      subjects. While the majority of queens were relegated after death to the
      crowd of shadowy ancestors to whom habitual sacrifice was offered, the
      worshippers not knowing even to which sex these royal personages belonged,
      the remembrance of Nofrîtari always remained distinct in their minds, and
      her cult spread till it might be said to have become a kind of popular
      religion. In this veneration Ahmosis was rarely associated with the queen,
      but Amenôthes and several of her other children shared in it&mdash;her son
      Sipiri, for instance, and her daughters Sîtamon,* Sîtkamosi, and
      Marîtamon; Nofrîtari became, in fact, an actual goddess, taking her place
      beside Amon, Khonsû, and Maut,** the members of the Theban Triad, or
      standing alone as an object of worship for her devotees.

      She was identified with Isis, Hathor, and the mistresses of Hades, and
      adopted their attributes, even to the black or blue coloured skin of these
      funerary divinities.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Her statue in the Turin Museum represents her as having
     black skin. She is also painted black standing before
     Amenôthes (who is white) in the Deir el-Medineh tomb, now
     preserved in the Berlin Museum, in that of Nibnûtîrû, and hi
     that of Unnofir, at Sheikh Abd el-Qûrnah. Her face is
     painted blue in the tomb of Kasa. The representations of
     this queen with a black skin have caused her to be taken for
     a negress, the daughter of an Ethiopian Pharaoh, or at any
     rate the daughter of a chief of some Nubian tribe; it was
     thought that Ahmosis must have married her to secure the
     help of the negro tribes in his wars, and that it was owing
     to this alliance that he succeeded in expelling the Hyksôs.
     Later discoveries have not confirmed these hypotheses.
     Nofrîtari was most probably an Egyptian of unmixed race, as
     we have seen, and daughter of Ahhotpû I., and the black or
     blue colour of her skin is merely owing to her
     identification with the goddesses of the dead.

      Considerable endowments were given for maintaining worship at her tomb,
      and were administered by a special class of priests. Her mummy reposed
      among those of the princes of her family, in the hiding-place at
      Deîr-el-Baharî: it was enclosed in an enormous wooden sarcophagus covered
      with linen and stucco, the lower part being shaped to the body, while the
      upper part representing the head and arms could be lifted off in one
      piece. The shoulders are covered with a network in relief, the meshes of
      which are painted blue on a yellow background. The Queen&rsquo;s hands are
      crossed over her breast, and clasp the <i>crux ansata</i>, the symbol of
      life. The whole mummy-case measures a little over nine feet from the sole
      of the feet to the top of the head, which is furthermore surmounted by a
      cap, and two long ostrich-feathers. The appearance is not so much that of
      a coffin as of one of those enormous caryatides which we sometimes find
      adorning the front of a temple.

      We may perhaps attribute to the influence of Nofrîtari the lack of zest
      evinced by Amenôthes for expeditions into Syria. Even the most energetic
      kings had always shrunk from penetrating much beyond the isthmus. Those
      who ventured so far as to work the mines of Sinai had nevertheless felt a
      secret fear of invading Asia proper&mdash;a dread which they never
      succeeded in overcoming. When the raids of the Bedouin obliged the
      Egyptian sovereign to cross the frontier into their territory, he would
      retire as soon as possible, without attempting any permanent conquest.
      After the expulsion of the Hyksôs, Ahmosis seemed inclined to pursue a
      less timorous course. He made an advance on Sharûhana and pillaged it, and
      the booty he brought back ought to have encouraged him to attempt more
      important expeditions; but he never returned to this region, and it would
      seem that when his first enthusiasm had subsided, he was paralysed by the
      same fear which had fallen on his ancestors. Nofrîtari may have counselled
      her son not to break through the traditions which his father had so
      strictly followed, for Amenôthes I. confined his campaigns to Africa, and
      the traditional battle-fields there. He embarked for the land of Kûsh on
      the vessel of Ahmosi-si-Abîna &ldquo;for the purpose of enlarging the frontiers
      of Egypt.&rdquo; It was, we may believe, a thoroughly conventional campaign,
      conducted according to the strictest precedents of the XIIth dynasty. The
      Pharaoh, as might be expected, came into personal contact with the enemy,
      and slew their chief with his own hand; the barbarian warriors sold their
      lives dearly, but were unable to protect their country from pillage, the
      victors carrying off whatever they could seize&mdash;men, women, and
      cattle. The pursuit of the enemy had led the army some distance into the
      desert, as far as a halting-place called the &ldquo;Upper cistern&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Khnûmît
      hirît</i>; instead of retracing his steps to the Nile squadron, and
      returning slowly by boat, Amenôthes resolved to take a short cut
      homewards. Ahmosi conducted him back overland in two days, and was
      rewarded for his speed by the gift of a quantity of gold, and two female
      slaves. An incursion into Libya followed quickly on the Ethiopian
      campaign.

      The tribe of the Kihaka, settled between Lake Mareotis and the Oasis of
      Amon, had probably attacked in an audacious manner the western provinces
      of the Delta; a raid was organized against them, and the issue was
      commemorated by a small wooden stele, on which we see the victor
      represented as brandishing his sword over a barbarian lying prostrate at
      his feet. The exploits of Amenôthes appear to have ended with this raid,
      for we possess no monument recording any further victory gained by him.
      This, however, has not prevented his contemporaries from celebrating him
      as a conquering and &lsquo;victorious king. He is portrayed standing erect in
      his chariot ready to charge, or as carrying off two barbarians whom he
      holds half suffocated in his sinewy arms, or as gleefully smiting the
      princes of foreign lands. He acquitted himself of the duties of the chase
      as became a true Pharaoh, for we find him depicted in the act of seizing a
      lion by the tail and raising him suddenly in mid-air previous to
      despatching him. These are, indeed, but conventional pictures of war, to
      which we must not attach an undue importance. Egypt had need of repose in
      order to recover from the losses it had sustained during the years of
      struggle with the invaders. If Amenôthes courted peace from preference and
      not from political motives, his own generation profited as much by his
      indolence as the preceding one had gained by the energy of Ahrnosis. The
      towns in his reign resumed their ordinary life, agriculture flourished,
      and commerce again followed its accustomed routes. Egypt increased its
      resources, and was thus able to prepare for future conquest. The taste for
      building had not as yet sufficiently developed to become a drain upon the
      public treasury. We have, however, records showing that Amenôthes
      excavated a cavern in the mountain of Ibrîm in Nubia, dedicated to Satît,
      one of the goddesses of the cataract.

      It is also stated that he worked regularly the quarries of Silsileh, but
      we do not know for what buildings the sandstone thus extracted was
      destined.* Karnak was also adorned with chapels, and with at least one
      colossus,** while several chambers built of the white limestone of Tûrah
      were added to Ombos. Thebes had thus every reason to cherish the memory of
      this pacific king.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A bas-relief on the western bank of the river represents
     him deified: Panaîti, the name of a superintendent of the
     quarries who lived in his reign, has been preserved in
     several graffiti, while another graffito gives us only the
     protocol of the sovereign, and indicates that the quarries
     were worked in his reign.

     ** The chambers of white limestone are marked I, K, on
     Mariette&rsquo;s plan; it is possible that they may have been
     merely decorated under Thûtmosis III., whose cartouches
     alternate with those of Amenôthes I. The colossus is now in
     front of the third Pylon, and Wiedemann concluded from this
     fact that Amenôthes had begun extensive works for enlarging
     the temple of Amon; Mariette believed, with greater
     probability, that the colossus formerly stood at the
     entrance to the XIIth dynasty temple, but was removed to its
     present position by Thûtmosis III.
</pre>
    <p>
      As Nofrîtari had been metamorphosed into a form of Isis, Amenôthes was
      similarly represented as Osiris, the protector of the Necropolis, and he
      was depicted as such with the sombre colour of the funerary divinities;
      his image, moreover, together with those of the other gods, was used to
      decorate the interiors of coffins, and to protect the mummies of his
      devotees.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Wiedemann has collected several examples, to which it
     would be easy to add others. The names of the king are in
     this case constantly accompanied by unusual epithets, which
     are enclosed in one or other of his cartouches: Mons.
     Kevillout, deceived by these unfamiliar forms, has made out
     of one of these variants, on a painted cloth in the Louvre,
     a new Amenôthes, whom he styles Amenôthes V.

      One of his statues, now in the Turin Museum, represents him sitting on his
      throne in the posture of a king giving audience to his subjects, or in
      that of a god receiving the homage of his worshippers. The modelling of
      the bust betrays a flexibility of handling which is astonishing in a work
      of art so little removed from barbaric times; the head is a marvel of
      delicacy and natural grace. We feel that the sculptor has taken a delight
      in chiselling the features of his sovereign, and in reproducing the
      benevolent and almost dreamy expression which characterised them.* The
      cult of Amenôthes lasted for seven or eight centuries, until the time when
      his coffin was removed and placed with those of the other members of his
      family in the place where it remained concealed until our own times.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Another statue of very fine workmanship, but mutilated, is
     preserved in the Gizeh Museum; this statue is of the time of
     Seti I., and, as is customary, represents Amenôthes in the
     likeness of the king then reigning.

     ** We know, from the Abbott Papyrus, that the pyramid of
     Amenôthes I. was situated at Dr-ah Abou&rsquo;l-Neggah, among
     those of the Pharaohs of the XIth, XIIth, and XVIIth
     dynasties. The remains of it have not yet been discovered.

      It is shaped to correspond with the form of the human body and painted
      white; the face resembles that of his statue, and the eyes of enamel,
      touched with kohl, give it a wonderful appearance of animation. The body
      is swathed in orange-coloured linen, kept in place by bands of brownish
      linen, and is further covered by a mask of wood and cartonnage, painted to
      match the exterior of the coffin. Long garlands of faded flowers deck the
      mummy from head to foot. A wasp, attracted by their scent, must have
      settled upon them at the moment of burial, and become imprisoned by the
      lid; the insect has been completely preserved from corruption by the
      balsams of the embalmer, and its gauzy wings have passed un-crumpled
      through the long centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amenôthes had married Ahhotpû II, his sister by the same father and
      mother;* Ahmasi, the daughter born of this union, was given in marriage to
      Thûtmosis, one of her brothers, the son of a mere concubine, by name
      Sonisonbû.** Ahmasi, like her ancestor Nofrîtari, had therefore the right
      to exercise all the royal functions, and she might have claimed precedence
      of her husband. Whether from conjugal affection or from weakness of
      character, she yielded, however, the priority to Thûtmosis, and allowed
      him to assume the sole government.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ahhotpû II. may be seen beside her husband on several
     monuments. The proof that she was full sister of Amenôthes
     I. is furnished by the title of &ldquo;hereditary princess&rdquo; which
     is given to her daughter Àhmasi; this princess would not
     have taken precedence of her brother and husband Thûtmosis,
     who was the son of an inferior wife, had she not been the
     daughter of the only legitimate spouse of Amenôthes I. The
     marriage had already taken place before the accession of
     Thûtmosis I., as Ahmasi figures in a document dated the
     first year of his reign.

     ** The absence of any cartouche shows that Sonisonbû did not
     belong to the royal family, and the very form of the name
     points her out to have been of the middle classes, and
     merely a concubine. The accession of her son, however,
     ennobled her, and he represents her as a queen on the walls
     of the temple at Deîr el-Baharî; even then he merely styles
     her &ldquo;Royal Mother,&rdquo; the only title she could really claim,
     as her inferior position in the harem prevented her from
     using that of &ldquo;Royal Spouse.&rdquo;

      He was crowned at Thebes on the 21st of the third month of Pirît; and a
      circular, addressed to the representatives of the ancient seignorial
      families and to the officers of the crown, announced the names assumed by
      the new sovereign. &ldquo;This is the royal rescript to announce to you that my
      Majesty has arisen king of the two Egypts, on the seat of the Horus of the
      living, without equal, for ever, and that my titles are as follows: The
      vigorous bull Horus, beloved of Mâît, the Lord of the Vulture and of the
      Uraeus who raises itself as a flame, most valiant,&mdash;the golden Horns,
      whose years are good and who puts life into all hearts, king of the two
      Egypts, Akhopirkerî, son of the Sun, Thûtmosis, living for ever.* Cause,
      therefore, sacrifices to be offered to the gods of the south and of
      Elephantine,** and hymns to be chanted for the well-being of the King
      Akhopirkerî, living for ever, and then cause the oath to be taken in the
      name of my Majesty, born of the royal mother Sonisonbû, who is in good
      health.&mdash;This is sent to thee that thou mayest know that the royal
      house is prosperous, and in good health and condition, the 1st year, the
      21st of the third month of Pirît, the day of coronation.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is really the protocol of the king, as we find it on
     the monuments, with his two Horus names and his solar
     titles.

     ** The copy of the letter which has come down to us is
     addressed to the commander of Elephantine: hence the mention
     of the gods of that town. The names of the divinities must
     have been altered to suit each district, to which the order
     to offer sacrifices for the prosperity of the new sovereign
     was sent.

      The new king was tall in stature, broad-shouldered, well knit, and capable
      of enduring the fatigues of war without flagging. His statues represent
      him as having a full, round face, long nose, square chin, rather thick
      lips, and a smiling but firm expression. Thûtmosis brought with him on
      ascending the throne the spirit of the younger generation, who, born
      shortly after the deliverance from the Hyksôs, had grown up in the
      peaceful days of Amenôthes, and, elated by the easy victories obtained
      over the nations of the south, were inspired by ambitions unknown to the
      Egyptians of earlier times. To this younger race Africa no longer offered
      a sufficiently wide or attractive field; the whole country was their own
      as far as the confluence of the two Niles, and the Theban gods were
      worshipped at Napata no less devoutly than at Thebes itself. What remained
      to be conquered in that direction was scarcely worth the trouble of
      reducing to a province or of annexing as a colony; it comprised a number
      of tribes hopelessly divided among themselves, and consequently, in spite
      of their renowned bravery, without power of resistance. Light columns of
      troops, drafted at intervals on either side of the river, ensured order
      among the submissive, or despoiled the refractory of their possessions in
      cattle, slaves, and precious stones. Thûtmosis I. had to repress, however,
      very shortly after his accession, a revolt of these borderers at the
      second and third cataracts, but they were easily overcome in a campaign of
      a few days&rsquo; duration, in which the two Âhmosis of Al-Kab took an
      honourable part. There was, as usual, an encounter of the two fleets in
      the middle of the river: the young king himself attacked the enemy&rsquo;s
      chief, pierced him with his first arrow, and made a considerable number of
      prisoners. Thûtmosis had the corpse of the chief suspended as a trophy in
      front of the royal ship, and sailed northwards towards Thebes, where,
      however, he was not destined to remain long.* An ample field of action
      presented itself to him in the north-east, affording scope for great
      exploits, as profitable as they were glorious.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * That this expedition must be placed at the beginning of
     the king&rsquo;s reign, in his first year, is shown by two facts:
     (1) It precedes the Syrian campaign in the biography of the
     two Âhmosis of El-Kab; (2) the Syrian campaign must have
     ended in the second year of the reign, since Thûtmosis I.,
     on the stele of Tombos which bears that date, gives
     particulars of the course of the Euphrates, and records the
     submission of the countries watered by that river. The date
     of the invasion may be placed between 2300 and 2250 B.C.; if
     we count 661 years for the three dynasties together, as
     Erman proposes, we find that the accession of Ahmosis would
     fall between 1640 and 1590. I should place it provisionally
     in the year 1600, in order not to leave the position of the
     succeeding reigns uncertain; I estimate the possible error
     at about half a century.

     ** It is impossible at present to draw up a correct table of
     the native or foreign sovereigns who reigned over Egypt
     during the time of the Hyksôs. I have given the list of the
     kings of the XIIIth and XIVth dynasties which are known to
     us from the Turin Papyrus. I here append that of the
     Pharaohs of the following dynasties, who are mentioned
     either in the fragments of Manetho or on the monuments:

      Syria offered to Egyptian cupidity a virgin prey in its large commercial
      towns inhabited by an industrious population, who by maritime trade and
      caravan traffic had amassed enormous wealth. The country had been
      previously subdued by the Chaldæans, who still exercised an undisputed
      influence over it, and it was but natural that the conquerors of the
      Hyksôs should act in their turn as invaders. The incursion of Asiatics
      into Egypt thus provoked a reaction which issued in an Egyptian invasion
      of Asiatic soil. Thûtmosis and his contemporaries had inherited none of
      the instinctive fear of penetrating into Syria which influenced Ahmosis
      and his successor: the Theban legions were, perhaps, slow to advance, but
      once they had trodden the roads of Palestine, they were not likely to
      forego the delights of conquest. From that time forward there was
      perpetual warfare and pillaging expeditions from the plains of the Blue
      Nile to those of the Euphrates, so that scarcely a year passed without
      bringing to the city of Amon its tribute of victories and riches gained at
      the point of the sword. One day the news would be brought that the
      Amorites or the Khâti had taken the field, to be immediately followed by
      the announcement that their forces had been shattered against the valour
      of the Egyptian battalions. Another day, Pharaoh would re-enter the city
      with the flower of his generals and veterans; the chiefs whom he had taken
      prisoners, sometimes with his own hand, would be conducted through the
      streets, and then led to die at the foot of the altars, while fantastic
      processions of richly clothed captives, beasts led by halters, and slaves
      bending under the weight of the spoil would stretch in an endless line
      behind him.

      Meanwhile the Timihû, roused by some unknown cause, would attack the
      outposts stationed on the frontier, or news would come that the Peoples of
      the Sea had landed on the western side of the Delta; the Pharaoh had again
      to take the field, invariably with the same speedy and successful issue.
      The Libyans seemed to fare no better than the Syrians, and before long
      those who had survived the defeat would be paraded before the Theban
      citizens, previous to being sent to join the Asiatic prisoners in the
      mines or quarries; their blue eyes and fair hair showing from beneath
      strangely shaped helmets, while their white skins, tall stature, and
      tattooed bodies excited for a few hours the interest and mirth of the idle
      crowd. At another time, one of the customary raids into the land of Kûsh
      would take place, consisting of a rapid march across the sands of the
      Ethiopian desert and a cruise along the coasts of Pûanîfc. This would be
      followed by another triumphal procession, in which fresh elements of
      interest would appear, heralded by flourish of trumpets and roll of drums:
      Pharaoh would re-enter the city borne on the shoulders of his officers,
      followed by negroes heavily chained, or coupled in such a way that it was
      impossible for them to move without grotesque contortions, while the
      acclamations of the multitude and the chanting of the priests would
      resound from all sides as the <i>cortege</i> passed through the city gates
      on its way to the temple of Amon. Egypt, roused as it were to warlike
      frenzy, hurled her armies across all her frontiers simultaneously, and her
      sudden appearance in the heart of Syria gave a new turn to human history.
      The isolation of the kingdoms of the ancient world was at an end; the
      conflict of the nations was about to begin.

      CHAPTER II&mdash;SYRIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nineveh and the first Cossæan kings&mdash;The peoples of Syria, their
      towns, their civilization, their religion&mdash;Phoenicia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world beyond the Arabian desert presented to the eyes of the
      enterprising Pharaohs an active and bustling scene. Babylonian
      civilization still maintained its hold there without a rival, but
      Babylonian rule had ceased to exercise any longer a direct control, having
      probably disappeared with the sovereigns who had introduced it. When
      Ammisatana died, about the year 2099, the line of Khammurabi became
      extinct, and a family from the Sea-lands came into power.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The origin of this second dynasty and the reading of its
     name still afford matter for discussion. Amid the many
     conflicting opinions, it behoves us to remember that
     Gulkishar, the only prince of this dynasty whose title we
     possess, calls himself <i>King of the Country of the Sea</i>,
     that is to say, of the marshy country at the mouth of the
     Euphrates: this simple fact directs us to seek the cradle of
     the family in those districts of Southern Chaldæa. Sayce
     rejects this identification on philological and
     chronological grounds, and sees in Gulkishar, &ldquo;King of the
     Sea-lands,&rdquo; a vassal Kaldâ prince.
</pre>
    <p>
      This unexpected revolution of affairs did not by any means restore to the
      cities of Lower Chaldæa the supreme authority which they once possessed.
      Babylon had made such good use of its centuries of rule that it had gained
      upon its rivals, and was not likely now to fall back into a secondary
      place. Henceforward, no matter what dynasty came into power, as soon as
      the fortune of war had placed it upon the throne, Babylon succeeded in
      adopting it, and at once made it its own. The new lord of the country,
      Ilumaîlu, having abandoned his patrimonial inheritance, came to reside
      near to Merodach.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name has been read An-ma-an or Anman by Pinches,
     subsequently Ilumaîlu, Mailu, finally Anumaîlu and perhaps
     Humaîlu. The true reading of it is still unknown. Hommel
     believed he had discovered in Hilprecht&rsquo;s book an
     inscription belonging to the reign of this prince; but
     Hilprecht has shown that it belonged to a king of Erech,
     An-a-an, anterior to the time of An-ma-an.
</pre>
    <p>
      He was followed during the four next centuries by a dynasty of ten
      princes, in uninterrupted succession. Their rule was introduced and
      maintained without serious opposition. The small principalities of the
      south were theirs by right, and the only town which might have caused them
      any trouble&mdash;Assur&mdash;was dependent on them, being satisfied with
      the title of vicegerents for its princes,&mdash;Khallu, Irishum, Ismidagan
      and his son Sarnsiramman I., Igurkapkapu and his son Sarnsiramman II.* As
      to the course of events beyond the Khabur, and any efforts Ilumaîlu&rsquo;s
      descendants may have made to establish their authority in the direction of
      the Mediterranean, we have no inscriptions to inform us, and must be
      content to remain in ignorance. The last two of these princes,
      Melamkurkurra and Eâgamîl, were not connected with each other, and had no
      direct relationship with their predecessors.** The shortness of their
      reigns presents a striking contrast with the length of those preceding
      them, and probably indicates a period of war or revolution. When these
      princes disappeared, we know not how or why, about the year 1714 B.C.,
      they were succeeded by a king of foreign extraction; and one of the
      semi-barbarous race of Kashshu ascended the throne which had been occupied
      since the days of Khammurabi by Chaldæans of ancient stock.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Inscription of Irishum, son of Khallu, on a brick found at
     Kalah-Shergat, and an inscription of Sarnsiramman II., son
     of Igurkapkapu, on another brick from the same place.
     Sarnsiramman I. and his father Ismidagan are mentioned in
     the great inscription of Tiglath-pileser II., as having
     lived 641 years before King Assurdân, who himself had
     preceded Tiglath-pileser by sixty years: they thus reigned
     between 1900 and 1800 years before our era, according to
     tradition, whose authenticity we have no other means of
     verifying.

     ** The name of the last is read Eâgamîl, for want of
     anything better: Oppert makes it Eâgâ, simply transcribing
     the signs; and Hilprecht, who took up the question again
     after him, has no reading to propose.

     *** I give here the list of the kings of the second dynasty,
     from the documents discovered by Pinches: No monument
     remains of any of these princes, and even the reading of
     their names is merely provisional: those placed between
     brackets represent Delitzsch&rsquo;s readings. A Gulkishar is
     mentioned in an inscription of Belnadiuabal; but Jensen is
     doubtful if the Gulkishar mentioned in this place is
     identical with the one in the lists.

      These Kashshu, who spring up suddenly out of obscurity, had from the
      earliest times inhabited the mountainous districts of Zagros, on the
      confines of Elymai&rsquo;s and Media, where the Cossæans of the classical
      historians flourished in the time of Alexander.*
    </p>
    <p>
      * The Kashshu are identified with the Cossæans by Sayce, by Schrader, by
      Fr. Delitzsch, by Halévy, by Tiele, by Hommel, and by Jensen. Oppert
      maintains that they answer to the Kissians of Herodotus, that is to say,
      to the inhabitants of the district of which Susa is the capital. Lehmann
      supports this opinion. Winckler gives none, and several Assyriologists
      incline to that of Kiepert, according to which the Kissians are identical
      with the Cossæans.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a rugged and unattractive country, protected by nature and easy to
      defend, made up as it was of narrow tortuous valleys, of plains of
      moderate extent but of rare fertility, of mountain chains whose grim sides
      were covered with forests, and whose peaks were snow-crowned during half
      the year, and of rivers, or, more correctly speaking, torrents, for the
      rains and the melting of the snow rendered them impassable in spring and
      autumn. The entrance to this region was by two or three well-fortified
      passes: if an enemy were unwilling to incur the loss of time and men
      needed to carry these by main force, he had to make a detour by narrow
      goat-tracks, along which the assailants were obliged to advance in single
      file, as best they could, exposed to the assaults of a foe concealed among
      the rocks and trees. The tribes who were entrenched behind this natural
      rampart made frequent and unexpected raids upon the marshy meadows and fat
      pastures of Chaldæa: they dashed through the country, pillaging and
      burning all that came in their way, and then, quickly regaining their
      hiding-places, were able to place their booty in safety before the
      frontier garrisons had recovered from the first alarm.* These tribes were
      governed by numerous chiefs acknowledging a single king&mdash;<i>ianzi</i>&mdash;whose
      will was supreme over nearly the whole country:** some of them had a
      slight veneer of Chaldæan civilization, while among the rest almost every
      stage of barbarism might be found. The remains of their language show that
      it was remotely allied to the dialect of Susa, and contained many Semitic
      words.*** What is recorded of their religion reaches us merely at second
      hand, and the groundwork of it has doubtless been modified by the
      Babylonian scribes who have transmitted it to us.****
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It was thus in the time of Alexander and his successors,
     and the information given by the classical historians about
     this period is equally applicable to earlier times, as we
     may conclude from the numerous passages from Assyrian
     inscriptions which have been collected by Fr. Delitzsch.

     ** Delitzsch conjectures that <i>Ianzi</i>, or <i>Ianzu</i>, had
     become a kind of proper name, analogous to the term
     <i>Pharaoh</i> employed by the Egyptians.

     *** A certain number of Cossæan words has been preserved and
     translated, some in one of the royal Babylonian lists, and
     some on a tablet in the British Museum, discovered and
     interpreted by Fr. Delitzsch. Several Assyriologists think
     that they showed a marked affinity with the idiom of the
     Susa inscriptions, and with that of the Achæmenian
     inscriptions of the second type; others deny the proposed
     connection, or suggest that the Cossæan language was a
     Semitic dialect, related to the Chaldæo-Assyrian. Oppert,
     who was the first to point out the existence of this
     dialect, thirty years ago, believed it to be the Elamite; he
     still persists in his opinion, and has published several
     notes in defence of it.

     **** It has been studied by Pr. Delitzsch, who insists on
     the influence which daily intercourse with the Chaldæans had
     on it after the conquest; Halévy, in most of the names of
     the gods given as Cossæan, sees merely the names of Chaldæan
     divinities slightly disguised in the writing.
</pre>
    <p>
      They worshipped twelve great gods, of whom the chief&mdash;Kashshu, the
      lord of heaven-gave his name to the principal tribe, and possibly to the
      whole race:* Shûmalia, queen of the snowy heights, was enthroned beside
      him,** and the divinities next in order were, as in the cities of the
      Euphrates, the Moon, the Sun (Sakh or Shuriash), the air or the tempest
      (Ubriash), and Khudkha.*** Then followed the stellar deities or secondary
      incarnations of the sun,&mdash;Mirizir, who represented both Istar and
      Beltis; and Khala, answering to Gula.****
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The existence of Kashshu is proved by the name of
     Kashshunadinakhé: Ashshur also bore a name identical with
     that of his worshippers.

     ** She is mentioned in a rescript of Nebuchadrezzar I., at
     the head of the gods of Namar, that is to say, the Cossæan
     deities, as &ldquo;the lady of the shining mountains, the
     inhabitants of the summits, the frequenter of peaks.&rdquo; She is
     called Shimalia in Rawlinson, but Delitzsch has restored her
     name which was slightly mutilated; one of her statues was
     taken by Samsirammân III., King of Assyria, in one of that
     sovereign&rsquo;s campaigns against Chaldæa.

     *** All these identifications are furnished by the glossary
     of Delitzsch. Ubriash, under the form of Buriash, is met
     with in a large number of proper names, Burnaburiash,
     Shagashaltiburiash, Ulamburiash, Kadashmanburiash, where the
     Assyrian scribe translates it <i>Bel-matâti</i>, lord of the
     world: Buriash is, therefore, an epithet of the god who was
     called Rammân in Chaldæa. The name of the moon-god is
     mutilated, and only the initial syllable Shi... remains,
     followed by an indistinct sign: it has not yet been
     restored.

     **** Halévy considers Khala, or Khali, as a harsh form of
     Gula: if this is the case, the Cossæans must have borrowed
     the name, and perhaps the goddess herself, from their
     Chaldæan neighbours.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Chaldæan Ninip corresponded both to Gidar and Maruttash, Bel to Kharbe
      and Turgu, Merodach to Shipak, Nergal to Shugab.* The Cossæan kings,
      already enriched by the spoils of their neighbours, and supported by a
      warlike youth, eager to enlist under their banner at the first call,**
      must have been often tempted to quit their barren domains and to swoop
      down on the rich country which lay at their feet. We are ignorant of the
      course of events which, towards the close of the XVIIIth century B.C., led
      to their gaining possession of it. The Cossæan king who seized on Babylon
      was named Gandish, and the few inscriptions we possess of his reign are
      cut with a clumsiness that betrays the barbarism of the conqueror. They
      cover the pivot stones on which Sargon of Agadê or one of the Bursins had
      hung the doors of the temple of Nippur, but which Gandish dedicated afresh
      in order to win for himself, in the eyes of posterity, the credit of the
      work of these sovereigns.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hilprecht has established the identity of Turgu with Bel
     of Nippur.

     ** Strabo relates, from some forgotten historian of
     Alexander, that the Cossæans &ldquo;had formerly been able to
     place as many as thirteen thousand archers in line, in the
     wars which they waged with the help of the Elymæans against
     the inhabitants of Susa and Babylon.&rdquo;

     *** The full name of this king, Gandish or Gandash, which is
     furnished by the royal lists, is written Gaddash on a
     monument in the British Museum discovered by Pinches, whose
     conclusions have been erroneously denied by Winckler. A
     process of abbreviation, of which there are examples in the
     names of other kings of the same dynasty, reduced the name
     to Gandê in the current language.
</pre>
    <p>
      Bel found favour in the eyes of the Cossæans who saw in him Kharbê or
      Turgu, the recognised patron of their royal family: for this reason
      Gandish and his successors regarded Bel with peculiar devotion. These
      kings did all they could for the decoration and endowment of the ancient
      temple of Ekur, which had been somewhat neglected by the sovereigns of
      purely Babylonian extraction, and this devotion to one of the most
      venerated Chaldæan sanctuaries contributed largely towards their winning
      the hearts of the conquered people.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hilpreoht calls attention on this point to the fact that
     no one has yet discovered at Nippur a single ex-voto
     consecrated by any king of the two first Babylonian
     dynasties.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Cossæan rule over the countries of the Euphrates was doubtless similar
      in its beginnings to that which the Hyksôs exercised at first over the
      nomes of Egypt. The Cossæan kings did not merely bring with them an army
      to protect their persons, or to occupy a small number of important posts;
      they were followed by the whole nation, and spread themselves over the
      entire country. The bulk of the invaders instinctively betook themselves
      to districts where, if they could not resume the kind of life to which
      they were accustomed in their own land, they could, at least give full
      rein to their love of a free and wild existence. As there were no
      mountains in the country, they turned to the marshes, and, like the Hyksôs
      in Egypt, made themselves at home about the mouths of the rivers, on the
      half-submerged low lands, and on the sandy islets of the lagoons which
      formed an undefined borderland between the alluvial region and the Persian
      Gulf. The covert afforded, by the thickets furnished scope for the chase
      which these hunters had been accustomed to pursue in the depths of their
      native forests, while fishing, on the other hand, supplied them with an
      additional element of food. When their depredations drew down upon them
      reprisals from their neighbours, the mounds occupied, by their fortresses,
      and surrounded by muddy swamps, offered them almost as secure retreats as
      their former strongholds on the lofty sides of the Zagros. They made
      alliances with the native Aramæans&mdash;with those Kashdi, properly
      called Chaldæans, whose name we have imposed upon all the nations who,
      from a very early date, bore rule on the banks of the Lower Euphrates.
      Here they formed themselves into a State&mdash;Karduniash&mdash;whose
      princes at times rebelled, against all external authority, and at other
      times acknowledged the sovereignty of the Babylonian monarchs.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The state of Karduniash, whose name appears for the first
     time on the monuments of the Cossæan period, has been
     localised in a somewhat vague manner, in the south of
     Babylonia, in the country of the Kashdi, and afterwards
     formally identified with the <i>Countries of the Sea</i>, and
     with the principality which was called Bît-Yâkin in the
     Assyrian period. In the Tel-el-Amarna tablets the name is
     already applied to the entire country occupied by the
     Cossæan kings or their descendants, that is to say, to the
     whole of Babylonia. Sargon II. at that time distinguishes
     between an Upper and a Lower Karduniash; and in consequence
     the earliest Assyriologists considered it as an Assyrian
     designation of Babylon, or of the district surrounding it,
     an opinion which was opposed by Delitzsch, as he believed it
     to be an indigenous term which at first indicated the
     district round Babylon, and afterwards the whole of
     Babylonia. From one frequent spelling of the name, the
     meaning appears to have been <i>Fortress of Duniash</i>; to this
     Delitzsch preferred the translation <i>Garden of Duniash</i>,
     from an erroneous different reading&mdash;Ganduniash: Duniash, at
     first derived from a Chaldæan God <i>Dun</i>, whose name may
     exist in <i>Dunghi</i>, is a Cossæan name, which the Assyrians
     translated, as they did Buriash, <i>Belmatâti</i>, lord of the
     country. Winckler rejects the ancient etymology, and
     proposes to divide the word as Kardu-niash and to see in it
     a Cossæan translation of the expression <i>mât-kaldi</i>, country
     of the Caldæans: Hommel on his side, as well as Delitzsch,
     had thought of seeking in the Chaldæans proper&mdash;<i>Kaldi</i> for
     <i>Kashdi</i>, or <i>Kash-da</i>, &ldquo;domain of the Cossæans &ldquo;&mdash;the
     descendants of the Cossæans of Karduniash, at least as far
     as race is concerned. In the cuneiform texts the name is
     written Kara&mdash;D. P. Duniyas, &ldquo;the Wall of the god
     Duniyas&rdquo; (cf. the Median Wall or Wall of Semiramis which
     defended Babylonia on the north).
</pre>
    <p>
      The people of Sumir and Akkad, already a composite of many different
      races, absorbed thus another foreign element, which, while modifying its
      homogeneity, did not destroy its natural character. Those Cossæan tribes
      who had not quitted their own country retained their original barbarism,
      but the hope of plunder constantly drew them from their haunts, and they
      attacked and devastated the cities of the plain unhindered by the thought
      that they were now inhabited by their fellow-countrymen. The raid once
      over, many of them did not return home, but took service under some
      distant foreign ruler&mdash;the Syrian princes attracting many, who
      subsequently became the backbone of their armies,* while others remained
      at Babylon and enrolled themselves in the body-guard of the kings.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Halévy has at least proved that the Khabiri mentioned in.
     the Tel el-Amarna tablets were Cossæans, contrary to the
     opinion of Sayce, who makes them tribes grouped round
     Hebron, which W. Max Müller seems to accept; Winckler,
     returning to an old opinion, believes them to have been
     Hebrews.
</pre>
    <p>
      To the last they were an undisciplined militia, dangerous, and difficult
      to please: one day they would hail their chiefs with acclamations, to kill
      them the next in one of those sudden outbreaks in which they were
      accustomed to make and unmake their kings.* The first invaders were not
      long in acquiring, by means of daily intercourse with the old inhabitants,
      the new civilization: sooner or later they became blended with the
      natives, losing all their own peculiarities, with the exception of their
      outlandish names, a few heroic legends,** and the worship of two or three
      gods&mdash;Shûmalia, Shugab, and Shukamuna.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is the opinion of Hommel, supported by the testimony
     of the <i>Synchronous Hist.</i>: in this latter document the
     Cossæans are found revolting against King Kadashmankharbé,
     and replacing him on the throne by a certain Nazibugash, who
     was of obscure origin.

     ** Pr. Delitzsch and Schrader compare their name with that
     of Kush, who appears in the Bible as the father of Nimrod
     (<i>Gen.</i> x. 8-12); Hommel and Sayce think that the history of
     Nimrod is a reminiscence of the Cossæan rule. Jensen is
     alone in his attempt to attribute to the Cossæans the first
     idea of the epic of Gilgames.
</pre>
    <p>
      As in the case of the Hyksôs in Africa, the barbarian conquerors thus
      became merged in the more civilized people which they had subdued. This
      work of assimilation seems at first to have occupied the whole attention
      of both races, for the immediate successors of Gandish were unable to
      retain under their rule all the provinces of which the empire was formerly
      composed. They continued to possess the territory situated on the middle
      course of the Euphrates as far as the mouth of the Balikh, but they lost
      the region extending to the east of the Khabur, at the foot of the Masios,
      and in the upper basin of the Tigris: the vicegerents of Assur also
      withdrew from them, and, declaring that they owed no obedience excepting
      to the god of their city, assumed the royal dignity. The first four of
      these kings whose names have come down to us, Sulili, Belkapkapu, Adasi,
      and Belbâni,* appear to have been but indifferent rulers, but they knew
      bow to hold their own against the attacks of their neighbours, and when,
      after a century of weakness and inactivity, Babylon reasserted herself,
      and endeavoured to recover her lost territory, they had so completely
      established their independence that every attack on it was unsuccessful.
      The Cossæan king at that time&mdash;an active and enterprising prince,
      whose name was held in honour up to the days of the Ninevite supremacy&mdash;was
      Agumkakrimê, the son of Tassigurumash.**

     * These four names do not so much represent four consecutive
     reigns as two separate traditions which were current
     respecting the beginnings of Assyrian royalty. The most
     ancient of them gives the chief place to two personages
     named Belkapkapu and Sulili; this tradition has been
     transmitted to us by Rammânnirâri III., because it connected
     the origin of his race with these kings. The second
     tradition placed a certain Belbâni, the son of Adasi, in the
     room of Belkapkapu and Sulili: Esarhaddon made use of it in
     order to ascribe to his own family an antiquity at least
     equal to that of the family to which Rammânnirâri III.
     belonged. Each king appropriated from the ancient popular
     traditions those names which seemed to him best calculated
     to enhance the prestige of his dynasty, but we cannot tell
     how far the personages selected enjoyed an authentic
     historical existence: it is best to admit them at least
     provisionally into the royal series, without trusting too
     much to what is related of them.

     ** The tablet discovered by Pinches is broken after the
     fifth king of the dynasty. The inscription of Agumkakrimê,
     containing a genealogy of this prince which goes back as far
     as the fifth generation, has led to the restoration of the
     earlier part of the list as follows:

     Gandish, Gaddash, Adumitasii .... 1655-? B.C.
     Gandê ........................... 1714-1707 B.C.
     Tassigurumash.................... ?
     Agumrabi, his son................ 1707-1685
     Agumkakrimê ..................... ?

      This &ldquo;brilliant scion of Shukamuna&rdquo; entitled himself lord of the Kashshu
      and of Akkad, of Babylon the widespread, of Padan, of Alman, and of the
      swarthy Guti.* Ashnunak had been devastated; he repeopled it, and the four
      &ldquo;houses of the world&rdquo; rendered him obedience; on the other hand, Elam
      revolted from its allegiance, Assur resisted him, and if he still
      exercised some semblance of authority over Northern Syria, it was owing to
      a traditional respect which the towns of that country voluntarily rendered
      to him, but which did not involve either subjection or control. The people
      of Khâni still retained possession of the statues of Merodach and of his
      consort Zarpanit, which had been stolen, we know not how, some time
      previously from Chaldæa.** Agumkakrimê recovered them and replaced them in
      their proper temple. This was an important event, and earned him the good
      will of the priests.

     * The translation <i>black-headed</i>, i.e. dark-haired and
     complexioned, <i>Guti</i>, is uncertain; Jensen interprets the
     epithet <i>nishi saldati</i> to mean &ldquo;the Guti, stupid (foolish?
     culpable?) people.&rdquo; The Guti held both banks of the lower
     Zab, in the mountains on the east of Assyria. Delitzsch has
     placed Padan and Alman in the mountains to the east of the
     Diyâleh; Jensen places them in the chain of the Khamrîn, and
     Winckler compares Alman or Halman with the Holwân of the
     present day.

     ** The Khâni have been placed by Delitzsch in the
     neighbourhood of Mount Khâna, mentioned in the accounts of
     the Assyrian campaigns, that is to say, in the Amanos,
     between the Euphrates and the bay of Alexandretta: he is
     inclined to regard the name as a form of that of the Khâti.

    <p>
      The king reorganised public worship; he caused new fittings for the
      temples to be made to take the place of those which had disappeared, and
      the inscription which records this work enumerates with satisfaction the
      large quantities of crystal, jasper, and lapis-lazuli which he lavished on
      the sanctuary, the utensils of silver and gold which he dedicated,
      together with the &ldquo;seas&rdquo; of wrought bronze decorated with monsters and
      religious emblems.* This restoration of the statues, so flattering to the
      national pride and piety, would have been exacted and insisted upon by a
      Khammurabi at the point of the sword, but Agumkakrimê doubtless felt that
      he was not strong enough to run the risk of war; he therefore sent an
      embassy to the Khâni, and such was the prestige which the name of Babylon
      still possessed, from the deserts of the Caspian to the shores of the
      Mediterranean, that he was able to obtain a concession from that people
      which he would probably have been powerless to extort by force of arms.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We do not possess the original of the inscription which
     tells us of these facts, but merely an early copy.

     ** Strictly speaking, one might suppose that a war took
     place; but most Assyriologists declare unhesitatingly that
     there was merely an embassy and a diplomatic negotiation.

    <p>
      The Egyptians had, therefore, no need to anticipate Chaldæan interference
      when, forsaking their ancient traditions, they penetrated for the first
      time into the heart of Syria. Not only was Babylon no longer supreme
      there, but the coalition of those cities on which she had depended for
      help in subduing the West was partially dissolved, and the foreign princes
      who had succeeded to her patrimony were so far conscious of their
      weakness, that they voluntarily kept aloof from the countries in which,
      previous to their advent, Babylon had held undivided sway. The Egyptian
      conquest of Syria had already begun in the days of Agumkakrimê, and it is
      possible that dread of the Pharaoh was one of the chief causes which
      influenced the Cossæans to return a favourable answer to the Khâni.
      Thûtmosis I., on entering Syria, encountered therefore only the native
      levies, and it must be admitted that, in spite of their renowned courage,
      they were not likely to prove formidable adversaries in Egyptian
      estimation. Not one of the local Syrian dynasties was sufficiently
      powerful to collect all the forces of the country around its chief, so as
      to oppose a compact body of troops to the attack of the African armies.
      The whole country consisted of a collection of petty states, a complex
      group of peoples and territories which even the Egyptians themselves never
      completely succeeded in disentangling. They classed the inhabitants,
      however, under three or four very comprehensive names&mdash;Kharû, Zahi,
      Lotanû, and Kefâtiû&mdash;all of which frequently recur in the
      inscriptions, but without having always that exactness of meaning we look
      for in geographical terms. As was often the case in similar circumstances,
      these names were used at first to denote the districts close to the
      Egyptian frontier with which the inhabitants of the Delta had constant
      intercourse. The Kefâtiû seem to have been at the outset the people of the
      sea-coast, more especially of the region occupied later by the
      Phoenicians, but all the tribes with whom the Phoenicians came in contact
      on the Asiatic and European border were before long included under the
      same name.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Kefâtiû, whose name was first read Kefa, and later
     Kefto, were originally identified with the inhabitants of
     Cyprus or Crete, and subsequently with those of Cilicia,
     although the decree of Canopus locates them in Phoenicia.
</pre>
    <p>
      Zahi originally comprised that portion of the desert and of the maritime
      plain on the north-east of Egypt which was coasted by the fleets, or
      traversed by the armies of Egypt, as they passed to and fro between Syria
      and the banks of the Nile. This region had been ravaged by Ahmosis during
      his raid upon Sharuhana, the year after the fall of Avaris. To the
      south-east of Zahi lay Kharû; it included the greater part of Mount Seir,
      whose wadys, thinly dotted over with oases, were inhabited by tribes of
      more or less stationary habits. The approaches to it were protected by a
      few towns, or rather fortified villages, built in the neighbourhood of
      springs, and surrounded by cultivated fields and poverty-stricken gardens;
      but the bulk of the people lived in tents or in caves on the
      mountain-sides. The Egyptians constantly confounded those Khauri, whom the
      Hebrews in after-times found scattered among the children of Edom, with
      the other tribes of Bedouin marauders, and designated them vaguely as
      Shaûsû. Lotanû lay beyond, to the north of Kharû and to the north-east of
      Zahi, among the hills which separate the &ldquo;Shephelah&rdquo; from the Jordan.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name of Lotanû or Rotanû has been assigned by Brugsch
     to the Assyrians, but subsequently, by connecting it, more
     ingeniously than plausibly, with the Assyrian <i>iltânu</i>, he
     extended it to all the peoples of the north; we now know
     that in the texts it denotes the whole of Syria, and, more
     generally, all the peoples dwelling in the basins of the
     Orontes and the Euphrates. The attempt to connect the name
     Rotanû or Lotanû with that of the Edomite tribe of Lotan
     (Gen. xxxvi. 20, 22) was first made by P. de Saulcy; it was
     afterwards taken up by Haigh and adopted by Renan.

      As it was more remote from the isthmus, and formed the Egyptian horizon in
      that direction, all the new countries with which the Egyptians became
      acquainted beyond its northern limits were by degrees included under the
      one name of Lotanû, and this term was extended to comprise successively
      the entire valley of the Jordan, then that of the Orontes, and finally
      even that of the Euphrates. Lotanû became thenceforth a vague and
      fluctuating term, which the Egyptians applied indiscriminately to widely
      differing Asiatic nations, and to which they added another indefinite
      epithet when they desired to use it in a more limited sense: that part of
      Syria nearest to Egypt being in this case qualified as Upper Lotanû, while
      the towns and kingdoms further north were described as being in Lower
      Lotanû. In the same way the terms Zahi and Kharû were extended to cover
      other and more northerly regions. Zahi was applied to the coast as far as
      the mouth of the Nahr el-Kebir and to the country of the Lebanon which lay
      between the Mediterranean and the middle course of the Orontes. Kharû ran
      parallel to Zahi, but comprised the mountain district, and came to include
      most of the countries which were at first ranged under Upper Lotanû; it
      was never applied to the region beyond the neighbourhood of Mount Tabor,
      nor to the trans-Jordanie provinces. The three names in their wider sense
      preserved the same relation to each other as before, Zahi lying to the
      west and north-west of Kharû, and Lower Lotanû to the north of Kharû and
      north-east of Zahi, but the extension of meaning did not abolish the old
      conception of their position, and hence arose confusion in the minds of
      those who employed them; the scribes, for instance, who registered in some
      far-off Theban temple the victories of the Pharaoh would sometimes write
      Zahi where they should have inscribed Kharû, and it is a difficult matter
      for us always to detect their mistakes. It would be unjust to blame them
      too severely for their inaccuracies, for what means had they of
      determining the relative positions of that confusing collection of states
      with which the Egyptians came in contact as soon as they had set foot on
      Syrian soil?
    </p>
    <p>
      A choice of several routes into Asia, possessing unequal advantages, was
      open to the traveller, but the most direct of them passed through the town
      of Zalû. The old entrenchments running from the Ked Sea to the marshes of
      the Pelusiac branch still protected the isthmus, and beyond these, forming
      an additional defence, was a canal on the banks of which a fortress was
      constructed. This was occupied by the troops who guarded the frontier, and
      no traveller was allowed to pass without having declared his name and
      rank, signified the business which took him into Syria or Egypt, and shown
      the letters with which he was entrusted.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The notes of an official living at Zalu in the time of
     Mîneptah are preserved on the back of pls. v., vi. of the
     <i>Anastasi Papyrus III</i>,; his business was to keep a register
     of the movements of the comers and goers between Egypt and
     Syria during a few days of the month Pakhons, in the year
     III.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was from Zalû that the Pharaohs set out with their troops, when
      summoned to Kharû by a hostile confederacy; it was to Zalû they returned
      triumphant after the campaign, and there, at the gates of the town, they
      were welcomed by the magnates of the kingdom. The road ran for some
      distance over a region which was covered by the inundation of the Nile
      during six months of the year; it then turned eastward, and for some
      distance skirted the sea-shore, passing between the Mediterranean and the
      swamp which writers of the Greek period called the Lake of Sirbonis.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Sirbonian Lake is sometimes half full of water,
     sometimes almost entirely dry; at the present time it bears
     the name of Sebkhat Berdawil, from King Baldwin I. of
     Jerusalem, who on his return from his Egyptian campaign died
     on its shores, in 1148, before he could reach El-Artsh.
</pre>
    <p>
      This stage of the journey was beset with difficulties, for the Sirbonian
      Lake did not always present the same aspect, and its margins were
      constantly shifting. When the canals which connected it with the open sea
      happened to become obstructed, the sheet of water subsided from
      evaporation, leaving in many places merely an expanse of shifting mud,
      often concealed under the sand which the wind brought up from the desert.
      Travellers ran imminent risk of sinking in this quagmire, and the Greek
      historians tell of large armies being almost entirely swallowed up in it.
      About halfway along the length of the lake rose the solitary hill of Mount
      Casios; beyond this the sea-coast widened till it became a vast slightly
      undulating plain, covered with scanty herbage, and dotted over with wells
      containing an abundant supply of water, which, however, was brackish and
      disagreeable to drink.

      Beyond these lay a grove of palms, a brick prison, and a cluster of
      miserable houses, bounded by a broad wady, usually dry. The bed of the
      torrent often served as the boundary between Africa and Asia, and the town
      was for many years merely a convict prison, where ordinary criminals,
      condemned to mutilation and exile, were confined; indeed, the Greeks
      assure us that it owed its name of Rhinocolûra to the number of noseless
      convicts who were to be seen there.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The ruins of the ancient town, which were of considerable
     extent, are half buried under the sand, out of which an
     Egyptian naos of the Ptolemaic period has been dug, and
     placed near the well which supplies the fort, where it
     serves as a drinking trough for the horses. Brugsch believed
     he could identify its site with that of the Syrian town
     Hurnikheri, which he erroneously reads Harinkola; the
     ancient form of the name is unknown, the Greek form varies
     between Rhinocorûra and Rhinocolûra. The story of the
     mutilated convicts is to be found in Diodorus Siculus, as
     well as in Strabo; it rests on a historical fact. Under the
     XVIIIth dynasty Zalû was used as a place of confinement for
     dishonest officials. For this purpose it was probably
     replaced by Rhinocolûra, when the Egyptian frontier was
     removed from the neighbourhood of Selle to that of El-Arîsh.
</pre>
    <p>
      At this point the coast turns in a north-easterly direction, and is
      flanked with high sand-hills, behind which the caravans pursue their way,
      obtaining merely occasional glimpses of the sea. Here and there, under the
      shelter of a tower or a half-ruined fortress, the traveller would have
      found wells of indifferent water, till on reaching the confines of Syria
      he arrived at the fortified village of Raphia, standing like a sentinel to
      guard the approach to Egypt. Beyond Raphia vegetation becomes more
      abundant, groups of sycamores and mimosas and clusters of date-palms
      appear on the horizon, villages surrounded with fields and orchards are
      seen on all sides, while the bed of a river, blocked with gravel and
      fallen rocks, winds its way between the last fringes of the desert and the
      fruitful Shephelah;* on the further bank of the river lay the suburbs of
      Gaza, and, but a few hundred yards beyond, Gaza itself came into view
      among the trees standing on its wall-crowned hill.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The term Shephelah signifies the plain; it is applied by
     the Biblical writers to the plain bordering the coast, from
     the heights of Gaza to those of Joppa, which were inhabited
     at a later period by the Philistines (<i>Josh</i>. xi. 16; <i>Jer</i>.
     xxxii. 44 and xxxiii. 13).

     ** Guérin describes at length the road from Gaza to Raphia.
     The only town of importance between them in the Greek period
     was Iênysos, the ruins of which are to be found near Khan
     Yunes, but the Egyptian name for this locality is unknown:
     Aunaugasa, the name of which Brugsch thought he could
     identify with it, should be placed much farther away, in
     Northern or in Coele-Syria.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Egyptians, on their march from the Nile valley, were wont to stop at
      this spot to recover from their fatigues; it was their first halting-place
      beyond the frontier, and the news which would reach them here prepared
      them in some measure for what awaited them further on. The army itself,
      the &ldquo;troop of Râ,&rdquo; was drawn from four great races, the most distinguished
      of which came, of course, from the banks of the Nile: the Amû, born of
      Sokhît, the lioness-headed goddess, were classed in the second rank; the
      Nahsi, or negroes of Ethiopia, were placed in the third; while the Timihû,
      or Libyans, with the white tribes of the north, brought up the rear. The
      Syrians belonged to the second of these families, that next in order to
      the Egyptians, and the name of Amu, which for centuries had been given
      them, met so satisfactorily all political, literary, or commercial
      requirements, that the administrators of the Pharaohs never troubled
      themselves to discover the various elements concealed beneath the term. We
      are, however, able at the present time to distinguish among them several
      groups of peoples and languages, all belonging to the same family, but
      possessing distinctive characteristics. The kinsfolk of the Hebrews, the
      children of Ishmael and Edom, the Moabites and Ammonites, who were all
      qualified as Shaûsû, had spread over the region to the south and east of
      the Dead Sea, partly in the desert, and partly on the confines of the
      cultivated land. The Canaanites were not only in possession of the coast
      from Gaza to a point beyond the Nahr el-Kebir, but they also occupied
      almost the whole valley of the Jordan, besides that of the Litâny, and
      perhaps that of the Upper Orontes.* There were Aramaean settlements at
      Damascus, in the plains of the Lower Orontes, and in Naharaim.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I use the term Canaanite with the meaning most frequently
     attached to it, according to the Hebrew use (<i>Gen</i>. x. 15-
     19). This word is found several times in the Egyptian texts
     under the forms Kinakhna, Kinakhkhi, and probably Kûnakhaîû,
     in the cuneiform texts of Tel el-Amarna.

     ** As far as I know, the term Aramæan is not to be found in
     any Egyptian text of the time of the Pharaohs: the only
     known example of it is a writer&rsquo;s error corrected by Chabas.
     W. Max Müller very justly observes that the mistake is
     itself a proof of the existence of the name and of the
     acquaintance of the Egyptians with it.
</pre>
    <p>
      The country beyond the Aramaean territory, including the slopes of the
      Amanos and the deep valleys of the Taurus, was inhabited by peoples of
      various origin; the most powerful of these, the Khâti, were at this time
      slowly forsaking the mountain region, and spreading by degrees over the
      country between the Afrîn and the Euphrates.*
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canaanites were the most numerous of all these groups, and had they
      been able to amalgamate under a single king, or even to organize a lasting
      confederacy, it would have been impossible for the Egyptian armies to have
      broken through the barrier thus raised between them and the rest of Asia;
      but, unfortunately, so far from showing the slightest tendency towards
      unity or concentration, the Canaanites were more hopelessly divided than
      any of the surrounding nations. Their mountains contained nearly as many
      states as there were valleys, while in the plains each town represented a
      separate government, and was built on a spot carefully selected for
      purposes of defence. The land, indeed, was chequered with these petty
      states, and so closely were they crowded together, that a horseman,
      travelling at leisure, could easily pass through two or three of them in a
      day&rsquo;s journey.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Thûtmosis III. shows that, at any rate, they were
     established in these regions about the XVIth century B.C.
     The Egyptian pronunciation of their name is <i>Khîti</i>, with
     the feminine <i>Khîtaît, Khîtit</i>; but the Tel el-Amarna texts
     employ the vocalisation <i>Khâti, Khâte</i>, which must be more
     correct than that of the Egyptians, The form <i>Khîti</i> seems
     to me to be explicable by an error of popular etymology.
     Egyptian ethnical appellations in <i>îti</i> formed their plural
     by <i>-âtiû, -âteê, -âti, -âte</i>, so that if <i>Khâte, Khâti</i>,
     were taken for a plural, it would naturally have suggested
     to the scribes the form <i>Khîti</i> for the singular.

     ** Thûtmosis III., speaking to his soldiers, tells them that
     all the chiefs the projecting spur of some mountain, or on a
     solitary and more or less irregularly shaped eminence in the
     midst of a plain, and the means of defence in the country
     are shut up in Megiddo, so that &ldquo;to take it is to take a
     thousand cities:&rdquo; this is evidently a hyperbole in the mouth
     of the conqueror, but the exaggeration itself shows how
     numerous were the chiefs and consequently the small states
     in Central and Southern Syria.
</pre>
    <p>
      Not only were the royal cities fenced with walls, but many of the
      surrounding villages were fortified, while the watch-towers, or <i>migdols</i>*
      built at the bends of the roads, at the fords over the rivers, and at the
      openings of the ravines, all testified to the insecurity of the times and
      the aptitude for self-defence shown by the inhabitants.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This Canaanite word was borrowed by the Egyptians from the
     Syrians at the beginning of their Asiatic wars; they
     employed it in forming the names of the military posts which
     they established on the eastern frontier of the Delta: it
     appears for the first time among Syrian places in the list
     of cities conquered by Thûtmosis III.

      The aspect of these migdols, or forts, must have appeared strange to the
      first Egyptians who beheld them. These strongholds bore no resemblance to
      the large square or oblong enclosures to which they were accustomed, and
      which in their eyes represented the highest skill of the engineer. In
      Syria, however, the positions suitable for the construction of fortresses
      hardly ever lent themselves to a symmetrical plan. The usual sites had to
      be adapted in each case to suit the particular configuration of the
      ground.

      It was usually a mere wall of stone or dried brick, with towers at
      intervals; the wall measuring from nine to twelve feet thick at the base,
      and from thirty to thirty-six feet high, thus rendering an assault by
      means of portable ladders, nearly impracticable.*

      The gateway had the appearance of a fortress in itself. It was composed of
      three large blocks of masonry, forming a re-entering face, considerably
      higher than the adjacent curtains, and pierced near the top with square
      openings furnished with mantlets, so as to give both a front and flank
      view of the assailants. The wooden doors in the receded face were covered
      with metal and raw hides, thus affording a protection against axe or
      fire.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Most of the Canaanite towns, taken by Ramses II. in the
     campaign of his VIIIth year were fortified in this manner.
     It must have been the usual method of fortification, as it
     seems to have served as a type for conventional
     representation, and was sometimes used to denote cities
     which had fortifications of another kind. For instance,
     Dapûr-Tabor is represented in this way, while a picture on
     another monument, which is reproduced in the illustration on
     page 185, represents what seems to have been the particular
     form of its encompassing walls.
</pre>
    <p>
      The building was strong enough not only to defy the bands of adventurers
      who roamed the country, but was able to resist for an indefinite time the
      operations of a regular siege. Sometimes, however, the inhabitants when
      constructing their defences did not confine themselves to this rudimentary
      plan, but threw up earthworks round the selected site. On the most exposed
      side they raised an advance wall, not exceeding twelve or fifteen feet in
      height, at the left extremity of which the entrance was so placed that the
      assailants, in endeavouring to force their way through, were obliged to
      expose an unprotected flank to the defenders. By this arrangement it was
      necessary to break through two lines of fortification before the place
      could be entered. Supposing the enemy to have overcome these first
      obstacles, they would find themselves at their next point of attack
      confronted with a citadel which contained, in addition to the sanctuary of
      the principal god, the palace of the sovereign himself. This also had a
      double enclosing wall and massively built gates, which could be forced
      only at the expense of fresh losses, unless the cowardice or treason of
      the garrison made the assault an easy one.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The type of town described in the text is based on a
     representation on the walls of Karnak, where the siege of
     Dapûr-Tabor by Ramses II. is depicted. Another type is given
     in the case of Ascalon.

      Of these bulwarks of Canaanite civilization, which had been thrown up by
      hundreds on the route of the invading hosts, not a trace is to be seen
      to-day. They may have been razed to the ground during one of those
      destructive revolutions to which the country was often exposed, or their
      remains may lie hidden underneath the heaps of ruins which thirty
      centuries of change have raised over them.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The only remains of a Canaanite fortification which can be
     assigned to the Egyptian period are those which Professor
     F. I. Petrie brought to light in the ruins of Tell el-Hesy,
     and in which he rightly recognised the remains of Lachish.

      The records of victories graven on the walls of the Theban temples
      furnish, it is true, a general conception of their appearance, but the
      notions of them which we should obtain from this source would be of a very
      confused character had not one of the last of the conquering Pharaohs,
      Ramses III., taken it into his head to have one built at Thebes itself, to
      contain within it, in addition to his funerary chapel, accommodation for
      the attendants assigned to the conduct of his worship. In the Greek and
      Roman period a portion of this fortress was demolished, but the external
      wall of defence still exists on the eastern side, together with the gate,
      which is commanded on the right by a projection of the enclosing-wall, and
      flanked by two guard-houses, rectangular in shape, and having roofs which
      jut out about a yard beyond the wall of support. Having passed through
      these obstacles, we find ourselves face to face with a <i>migdol</i> of
      cut stone, nearly square in form, with two projecting wings, the court
      between their loop-holed walls being made to contract gradually from the
      point of approach by a series of abutments. A careful examination of the
      place, indeed, reveals more than one arrangement which the limited
      knowledge of the Egyptians would hardly permit us to expect. We discover,
      for instance, that the main body of the building is made to rest upon a
      sloping sub-structure which rises to a height of some sixteen feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This served two purposes: it increased, in the first place, the strength
      of the defence against sapping; and in the second, it caused the weapons
      launched by the enemy to rebound with violence from its inclined surface,
      thus serving to keep the assailants at a distance. The whole structure has
      an imposing look, and it must be admitted that the royal architects
      charged with carrying out their sovereign&rsquo;s idea brought to their task an
      attention to detail for which the people from whom the plan was borrowed
      had no capacity, and at the same time preserved the arrangements of their
      model so faithfully that we can readily realise what it must have been.
      Transport this migdol of Ramses III. into Asia, plant it upon one of those
      hills which the Canaanites were accustomed to select as a site for their
      fortifications, spread out at its base some score of low and miserable
      hovels, and we have before us an improvised pattern of a village which
      recalls in a striking manner Zerîn or Beîtîn, or any other small modern
      town which gathers the dwellings of its fellahin round some central stone
      building&mdash;whether it be a hostelry for benighted travellers, or an
      ancient castle of the Crusading age.

      There were on the littoral, to the north of Gaza, two large walled towns,
      Ascalon and Joppa, in whose roadsteads merchant vessels were accustomed to
      take hasty refuge in tempestuous weather.* There were to be found on the
      plains also, and on the lower slopes of the mountains, a number of similar
      fortresses and villages, such as Iurza, Migdol, Lachish, Ajalon, Shocho,
      Adora, Aphukîn, Keilah, Gezer, and Ono; and, in the neighbourhood of the
      roads which led to the fords of the Jordan, Gibeah, Beth-Anoth, and
      finally Urusalim, our Jerusalem.** A tolerably dense population of active
      and industrious husbandmen maintained themselves upon the soil.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ascalon was not actually on the sea. Its port, &ldquo;Maiumas
     Ascalonis,&rdquo; was probably merely a narrow bay or creek, now,
     for a long period, filled up by the sand. Neither the site
     nor the remains of the port have been discovered. The name
     of the town is always spelled in Egyptian with an &ldquo;s &ldquo;&mdash;
     Askaluna, which gives us the pronunciation of the time. The
     name of Joppa is written Yapu, Yaphu, and the gardens which
     then surrounded the town are mentioned in the <i>Anastasi
     Papyrus I</i>.

     ** Urusalim is mentioned only in the Tel el-Amarna tablets,
     alongside of Kilti or Keilah, Ajalon, and Lachish. The
     remaining towns are noticed in the great lists of Thûtmosis
     III.

      The plough which they employed was like that used by the Egyptians and
      Babylonians, being nothing but a large hoe to which a couple of oxen were
      harnessed.* The scarcity of rain, except in certain seasons, and the
      tendency of the rivers to run low, contributed to make the cultivators of
      the soil experts in irrigation and agriculture. Almost the only remains of
      these people which have come down ti us consist of indestructible wells
      and cisterns, or wine and oil presses hollowed out of the rock.**

      Fields of wheat and barley extended along the flats of the valleys, broken

      Jerusalem, possibly in part to be attributed to the reign of Solomon, are
      the only instances to which anything like a certain date may be assigned.
      But these are long posterior to the XVIIIth dynasty. Good judges, however,
      attribute some of these monuments to a very distant period: the masonry of
      the wells of Beersheba is very ancient, if not as it is at present, at
      least as it was when it was repaired in the time of the Cæsars; the olive
      and wine presses hewn in the rock do not all date back to the Roman
      empire, but many belong to a still earlier period, and modern descriptions
      correspond with what we know of such presses from the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the slopes of the valley rose too precipitously for cultivation, stone
      dykes were employed to collect the falling earth, and thus to transform
      the sides of the hills into a series of terraces rising one above the
      other. Here the vines, planted in lines or in trellises, blended their
      clusters with the fruits of the orchard-trees. It was, indeed, a land of
      milk and honey, and its topographical nomenclature in the Egyptian
      geographical lists reflects as in a mirror the agricultural pursuits of
      its ancient inhabitants: one village, for instance, is called Aubila, &ldquo;the
      meadow;&rdquo; while others bear such names as Ganutu, &ldquo;the gardens;&rdquo; Magraphut,
      &ldquo;the mounds;&rdquo; and Karman, &ldquo;the vineyard.&rdquo; The further we proceed towards
      the north, we find, with a diminishing aridity, the hillsides covered with
      richer crops, and the valleys decked out with a more luxuriant and warmly
      coloured vegetation. Shechem lies in an actual amphitheatre of verdure,
      which is irrigated by countless unfailing streams; rushing brooks babble
      on every side, and the vapour given off by them morning and evening covers
      the entire landscape with a luminous haze, where the outline of each
      object becomes blurred, and quivers in a manner to which we are accustomed
      in our Western lands.* Towns grew and multiplied upon this rich and loamy
      soil, but as these lay outside the usual track of the invading hosts&mdash;which
      preferred to follow the more rugged but shorter route leading straight to
      Carmel across the plain&mdash;the records of the conquerors only casually
      mention a few of them, such as Bîtshaîlu, Birkana, and Dutîna.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Shechem is not mentioned in the Egyptian geographical
     lists, but Max Müller thinks he has discovered it in the
     name of the mountain of Sikima which figures in the
     <i>Anastasi Papyrus</i>, No. 1.

     ** Bîtshaîlu, identified by Chabas with Bethshan, and with
     Shiloh by Mariette and Maspero, is more probably Bethel,
     written Bît-sha-îlu, either with <i>sh</i>, the old relative
     pronoun of the Phoenician, or with the Assyrian <i>sha</i>; on
     the latter supposition one must suppose, as Sayce does, that
     the compiler of the Egyptian lists had before him sources of
     information in the cuneiform character. Birkana appears to
     be the modern Brukin, and Dutîna is certainly Dothain, now
     Tell-Dothân.
</pre>
    <p>
      Beyond Ono reddish-coloured sandy clay took the place of the dark and
      compact loam: oaks began to appear, sparsely at first, but afterwards
      forming vast forests, which the peasants of our own days have thinned and
      reduced to a considerable extent. The stunted trunks of these trees are
      knotted and twisted, and the tallest of them do not exceed some thirty
      feet in height, while many of them may be regarded as nothing more
      imposing than large bushes.* Muddy rivers, infested with crocodiles,
      flowed slowly through the shady woods, spreading out their waters here and
      there in pestilential swamps. On reaching the seaboard, their exit was
      impeded by the sands which they brought down with them, and the banks
      which were thus formed caused the waters to accumulate in lagoons
      extending behind the dunes. For miles the road led through thickets,
      interrupted here and there by marshy places and clumps of thorny shrubs.
      Bands of Shaûsû were accustomed to make this route dangerous, and even the
      bravest heroes shrank from venturing alone along this route. Towards Aluna
      the way began to ascend Mount Carmel by a narrow and giddy track cut in
      the rocky side of the precipice.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The forest was well known to the geographers of the Græco-
     Roman period, and was still in existence at the time of the
     Crusades.

     ** This defile is described at length in the <i>Anastasi
     Papyrus</i>, No. 1, and the terms used by the writer are in
     themselves sufficient evidence of the terror with which the
     place inspired the Egyptians. The annals of Thûtmosis III.
     are equally explicit as to the difficulties which an army
     had to encounter here. I have placed this defile near the
     point which is now called Umm-el-Fahm, and this site seems
     to me to agree better with the account of the expedition of
     Thûtmosis III. than that of Arraneh proposed by Conder.

      Beyond the Mount, it led by a rapid descent into a plain covered with corn
      and verdure, and extending in a width of some thirty miles, by a series of
      undulations, to the foot of Tabor, where it came to an end. Two side
      ranges running almost parallel&mdash;little Hermon and Glilboa&mdash;disposed
      in a line from east to west, and united by an almost imperceptibly rising
      ground, serve rather to connect the plain of Megiddo with the valley of
      the Jordan than to separate them. A single river, the Kishon, cuts the
      route diagonally&mdash;or, to speak more correctly, a single river-bed,
      which is almost waterless for nine months of the year, and becomes swollen
      only during the winter rains with the numerous torrents bursting from the
      hillsides. As the flood approaches the sea it becomes of more manageable
      proportions, and finally distributes its waters among the desolate lagoons
      formed behind the sand-banks of the open and wind-swept bay, towered over
      by the sacred summit of Carmel.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the lists of Thûtmosis III. we find under No. 48 the
     town of Rosh-Qodshu, the &ldquo;Sacred Cape,&rdquo; which was evidently
     situated at the end of the mountain range, or probably on
     the site of Haifah; the name itself suggests the veneration
     with which Carmel was invested from the earliest times.
</pre>
    <p>
      No corner of the world has been the scene of more sanguinary engagements,
      or has witnessed century after century so many armies crossing its borders
      and coming into conflict with one another. Every military leader who,
      after leaving Africa, was able to seize Gaza and Ascalon, became at once
      master of Southern Syria. He might, it is true, experience some local
      resistance, and come into conflict with bands or isolated outposts of the
      enemy, but as a rule he had no need to anticipate a battle before he
      reached the banks of the Kishon.

      Here, behind a screen of woods and mountain, the enemy would concentrate
      his forces and prepare resolutely to meet the attack. If the invader
      succeeded in overcoming resistance at this point, the country lay open to
      him as far as the Orontes; nay, often even to the Euphrates. The position
      was too important for its defence to have been neglected. A range of
      forts, Ibleâm, Taanach, and Megiddo,* drawn like a barrier across the line
      of advance, protected its southern face, and beyond these a series of
      strongholds and villages followed one another at intervals in the bends of
      the valleys or on the heights, such as Shunem, Kasuna, Anaharath, the two
      Aphuls, Cana, and other places which we find mentioned on the triumphal

      Acre was the first port where a fleet could find safe anchorage after
      leaving the mouths of the Nile, and whoever was able to make himself
      master of it had in his hands the key of Syria, for it stood in the same
      commanding position with regard to the coast as that held by Megiddo in
      respect of the interior. Its houses were built closely together on a spit
      of rock which projected boldly into the sea, while fringes of reefs formed
      for it a kind of natural breakwater, behind which ships could find a safe
      harbourage from the attacks of pirates or the perils of bad weather. From
      this point the hills come so near the shore that one is sometimes obliged
      to wade along the beach to avoid a projecting spur, and sometimes to climb
      a zig-zag path in order to cross a headland. In more than one place the
      rock has been hollowed into a series of rough steps, giving it the
      appearance of a vast ladder.* Below this precipitous path the waves dash
      with fury, and when the wind sets towards the land every thud causes the
      rocky wall to tremble, and detaches fragments from its surface. The
      majority of the towns, such as Aksapu (Ecdippa), Mashal, Lubina,
      Ushu-Shakhan, lay back from the sea on the mountain ridges, out of the
      reach of pirates; several, however, were built on the shore, under the
      shelter of some promontory, and the inhabitants of these derived a
      miserable subsistence from fishing and the chase. Beyond the Tyrian Ladder
      Phoenician territory began. The country was served throughout its entire
      length, from town to town, by the coast road, which turning at length to
      the right, and passing through the defile formed by the Nahr-el-Kebîr,
      entered the region of the middle Orontes.

      The second of the roads leading from Megiddo described an almost
      symmetrical curve eastwards, crossing the Jordan at Beth-shan, then the
      Jab-bok, and finally reaching Damascus after having skirted at some
      distance the last of the basaltic ramparts of the Haurân. Here extended a
      vast but badly watered pasture-land, which attracted the Bedouin from
      every side, and scattered over it were a number of walled towns, such as
      Hamath, Magato, Ashtaroth, and Ono-Eepha.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Proof that the Egyptians knew this route, followed even to
     this day in certain circumstances, is furnished by the lists
     of Thûtmosis III., in which the principal stations which it
     comprises are enumerated among the towns given up after the
     victory of Megiddo. Dimasqu was identified with Damascus by
     E. de Rougé, and Astarotu with Ashtarôth-Qarnaim. Hamatu is
     probably Hamath of the Gadarenes; Magato, the Maged of the
     Maccabees, is possibly the present Mukatta; and Ono-Repha,
     Raphôn, Raphana, Arpha of Decapolis, is the modern Er-Rafeh.
</pre>
    <p>
      Probably Damascus was already at this period the dominant authority over
      the region watered by these two rivers, as well as over the villages
      nestling in the gorges of Hermon,&mdash;Abila, Helbôn of the vineyards,
      and Tabrûd,&mdash;but it had not yet acquired its renown for riches and
      power. Protected by the Anti-Lebanon range from its turbulent neighbours,
      it led a sort of vegetative existence apart from invading hosts, forgotten
      and hushed to sleep, as it were, in the shade of its gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third road from Megiddo took the shortest way possible. After crossing
      the Kishon almost at right angles to its course, it ascended by a series
      of steep inclines to arid plains, fringed or intersected by green and
      flourishing valleys, which afforded sites for numerous towns,&mdash;Pahira,
      Merom near Lake Huleh, Qart-Nizanu, Beerotu, and Lauîsa, situated in the
      marshy district at the head-waters of the Jordan.* From this point forward
      the land begins to fall, and taking a hollow shape, is known as
      Coele-Syria, with its luxuriant vegetation spread between the two ranges
      of the Lebanon. It was inhabited then, as at the time of the Babylonian
      conquest, by the Amorites, who probably included Damascus also in their
      domain.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Pahira is probably Safed; Qart-Nizanu, the &ldquo;flowery city,&rdquo;
      the Kartha of Zabulon; and Bcerôt, the Berotha of Josephus,
     near Merom. Maroma and Lauîsa, Laisa, have been identified
     with Merom and Laish.

     ** The identification of the country of Amâuru with that of
     the Amorites was admitted from the first. The only doubt was
     as to the locality occupied by these Amorites: the mention
     of Qodshu on the Orontes, in the country of the Amurru,
     showed that Coele-Syria was the region in question. In the
     Tel el-Amarna tablets the name Amurru is applied also to the
     country east of the Phoenician coast, and we have seen that
     there is reason to believe that it was used by the
     Babylonians to denote all Syria. If the name given by the
     cuneiform inscriptions to Damascus and its neighbourhood,
     &ldquo;Gar-Imirîshu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Imirîshu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Imirîsh,&rdquo; really means &ldquo;the
     Fortress of the Amorites,&rdquo; we should have in this fact a
     proof that this people were in actual possession of the
     Damascene Syria. This must have been taken from them by the
     Hittites towards the XXth century before our era, according
     to Hommel; about the end of the XVIIIth dynasty, according
     to Lenormant. If, on the other hand, the Assyrians read the
     name &ldquo;Sha-imiri-shu,&rdquo; with the signification, &ldquo;the town of
     its asses,&rdquo; it is simply a play upon words, and has no
     bearing upon the primitive meaning of the name.

      Their capital, the sacred Qodshu, was situated on the left bank of the
      Orontes, about five miles from the lake which for a long time bore its
      name, Bahr-el-Kades.* It crowned one of those barren oblong eminences
      which are so frequently met with in Syria. A muddy stream, the Tannur,
      flowed, at some distance away, around its base, and, emptying itself into
      the Orontes at a point a little to the north, formed a natural defence for
      the town on the west. Its encompassing walls, slightly elliptic in form,
      were strengthened by towers, and surrounded by two concentric ditches
      which kept the sapper at a distance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name Qodshu-Kadesh was for a long time read Uatesh,
     Badesh, Atesh, and, owing to a confusion with Qodi, Ati, or
     Atet. The town was identified by Champollion with Bactria,
     then transferred to Mesopotamia by Bosollini, in the land of
     Omira, which, according to Pliny, was close to the Taurus,
     not far from the Khabur or from the province of Aleppo:
     Osburn tried to connect it with Hadashah (<i>Josh</i>. xv. 21),
     an Amorite town in the southern part of the tribe of Judah;
     while Hincks placed it in Edessa. The reading Kedesh,
     Kadesh, Qodshu, the result of the observations of Lepsius,
     has finally prevailed. Brugsch connected this name with that
     of Bahr el-Kades, a designation attached in the Middle Ages
     to the lake through which the Orontes flows, and placed the
     town on its shores or on a small island on the lake. Thomson
     pointed out Tell Neby-Mendeh, the ancient Laodicea of the
     Lebanon, as satisfying the requirements of the site. Conder
     developed this idea, and showed that all the conditions
     prescribed by the Egyptian texts in regard to Qodshu find
     here, and here alone, their application. The description
     given in the text is based on Conder&rsquo;s observations.

      A dyke running across the Orontes above the town caused the waters to rise
      and to overflow in a northern direction, so as to form a shallow lake,
      which acted as an additional protection from the enemy. Qodshu was thus a
      kind of artificial island, connected with the surrounding country by two
      flying bridges, which could be opened or shut at pleasure. Once the
      bridges were raised and the gates closed, the boldest enemy had no
      resource left but to arm himself with patience and settle down to a
      lengthened siege. The invader, fresh from a victory at Megiddo, and
      following up his good fortune in a forward movement, had to reckon upon
      further and serious resistance at this point, and to prepare himself for a
      second conflict. The Amorite chiefs and their allies had the advantage of
      a level and firm ground for the evolutions of their chariots during the
      attack, while, if they were beaten, the citadel afforded them a secure
      rallying-place, whence, having gathered their shattered troops, they could
      regain their respective countries, or enter, with the help of a few
      devoted men, upon a species of guerilla warfare in which they excelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road from Damascus led to a point south of Quodshu, while that from
      Phonicia came right up to the town itself or to its immediate
      neighbourhood. The dyke of Bahr el-Kades served to keep the plain in a dry
      condition, and thus secured for numerous towns, among which Hamath stood
      out pre-eminently, a prosperous existence. Beyond Hamath, and to the left,
      between the Orontes and the sea, lay the commercial kingdom of Alasia,
      protected from the invader by bleak mountains.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The site of Alasia, Alashia, was determined from the Tel
     el-Amarna tablets by Maspero. Niebuhr had placed it to the
     west of Cilicia, opposite the island of Eleousa mentioned by
     Strabo. Conder connected it with the scriptural Elishah, and
     W. Max Millier confounds it with Asi or Cyprus.
</pre>
    <p>
      On the right, between the Orontes and the Balikh, extended the land of
      rivers, Naharaim. Towns had grown up here thickly,&mdash;on the sides of
      the torrents from the Amanos, along the banks of rivers, near springs or
      wells&mdash;wherever, in fact, the presence of water made culture
      possible. The fragments of the Egyptian chronicles which have come down to
      us number these towns by the hundred,* and yet of how many more must the
      records have perished with the crumbling Theban walls upon which the
      Pharaohs had their names incised! Khalabu was the Aleppo of our own day,**
      and grouped around it lay Turmanuna, Tunipa, Zarabu, Nîi, Durbaniti,
      Nirabu, Sarmata,*** and a score of others which depended upon it, or upon
      one of its rivals. The boundaries of this portion of the Lower Lotanû have
      come down to us in a singularly indefinite form, and they must also,
      moreover, have been subject to continual modifications from the results of
      tribal conflicts.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Two hundred and thirty names belonging to Naharaim are
     still legible on the lists of Thûtmosis III., and a hundred
     others have been effaced from the monument.

     ** Khalabu was identified by Chabas with Khalybôn, the
     modern Aleppo, and his opinion has been adopted by most
     Egyptologists.

     *** Tunipa has been found in Tennib, Tinnab, by Noldoke;
     Zarabu in Zarbi, and Sarmata in Sarmeda, by Tomkins;
     Durbaniti in Deîr el-Banât, the Castrum Puellarum of the
     chroniclers of the Crusades; Nirabu in Nirab, and Tirabu in
     Tereb, now el-Athrib. Nirab is mentioned by Nicholas of
     Damascus. Nîi, long confounded with Nineveh, was identified
     by Lenormant with Ninus Vetus, Membidj, and by Max Millier
     with Balis on the Euphrates: I am inclined to make it Kefer-
     Naya, between Aleppo and Turmanin.

      We are at a loss to know whether the various principalities were

      Carchemish represented in this region the position occupied by Megiddo in
      relation to Kharû, and by Qodshu among the Amorites; that is to say, it

      make himself master of it would have the whole country at his feet.

      It lay upon the Euphrates, the winding of the river protecting it on its
      southern and south-eastern sides, while around its northern front ran a
      deep stream, its defence being further completed by a double ditch across
      the intervening region. Like Qodshu, it was thus situated in the midst of
      an artificial island beyond the reach of the battering-ram or the sapper.
      The encompassing wall, which tended to describe an ellipse, hardly
      measured two miles in circumference; but the suburbs extending, in the
      midst of villas and gardens, along the river-banks furnished in time of
      peace an abode for the surplus population. The wall still rises some five
      and twenty to thirty feet above the plain. Two mounds divided by a ravine
      command its north-western side, their summits being occupied by the ruins
      of two fine buildings&mdash;a temple and a palace.* Carchemish was the
      last stage in a conqueror&rsquo;s march coming from the south.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Karkamisha, Gargamish, was from the beginning associated
     with the Carchemish of the Bible; but as the latter was
     wrongly identified with Circesium, it was naturally located
     at the confluence of the Khabur with the Euphrates. Hincks
     fixed the site at Rum-Kaleh. G. Rawlinson referred it
     cursorily to Hierapolis-Mabog, which position Maspero
     endeavoured to confirm. Finzi, and after him G. Smith,
     thought to find the site at Jerabis, the ancient Europos,
     and excavations carried on there by the English have brought
     to light in this place Hittite monuments which go back in
     part to the Assyrian epoch. This identification is now
     generally accepted, although there is still no direct proof
     attainable, and competent judges continue to prefer the site
     of Membij. I fall in with the current view, but with all
     reserve.

      For an invader approaching from the east or north it formed his first
      station. He had before him, in fact, a choice of the three chief fords for
      crossing the Euphrates. That of Thapsacus, at the bend of the river where
      it turns eastward to the Arabian plain, lay too far to the south, and it
      could be reached only after a march through a parched and desolate region
      where the army would run the risk of perishing from thirst.

      For an invader proceeding from Asia Minor, or intending to make his way
      through the defiles of the Taurus, Samosata offered a convenient
      fording-place; but this route would compel the general, who had Naharaim
      or the kingdoms of Chaldæa in view, to make a long detour, and although
      the Assyrians used it at a later period, at the time of their expeditions
      to the valleys of the Halys, the Egyptians do not seem ever to have
      travelled by this road. Carchemish, the place of the third ford, was about
      equally distant from Thapsacus and Samosata, and lay in a rich and fertile
      province, which was so well watered that a drought or a famine would not
      be likely to enter into the expectations of its inhabitants. Hither
      pilgrims, merchants, soldiers, and all the wandering denizens of the world
      were accustomed to direct their steps, and the habit once established was
      perpetuated for centuries. On the left bank of the river, and almost
      opposite Carchemish, lay the region of Mitânni,* which was already
      occupied by a people of a different race, who used a language cognate, it
      would seem, with the imperfectly classified dialects spoken by the tribes
      of the Upper Tigris and Upper Euphrates.** Harran bordered on Mitânni, and
      beyond Harran one may recognise, in the vaguely defined Singar, Assur,
      Arrapkha, and Babel, states that arose out of the dismemberment of the
      ancient Chaldæan Empire.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mitânni is mentioned on several Egyptian monuments; but
     its importance was not recognised until after the discovery
     of the Tel el-Amarna tablets and of its situation. The fact
     that a letter from the Prince of Mitânni is stated in a
     Hieratic docket to have come from Naharaim has been used as
     a proof that the countries were identical; I have shown that
     the docket proves only that Mitânni formed a part of
     Naharaim. It extended over the province of Edessa and
     Harran, stretching out towards the sources of the Tigris.
     Niebuhr places it on the southern slope of the Masios, in
     Mygdonia; Th. Reinach connects it with the Matiôni, and asks
     whether this was not the region occupied by this people
     before their emigration towards the Caspian.

     ** Several of the Tel el-Amarna tablets are couched in this
     language.

      The Carchemish route was, of course, well known to caravans, but armed
      bodies had rarely occasion to make use of it. It was a far cry from
      Memphis to Carchemish, and for the Egyptians this town continued to be a
      limit which they never passed, except incidentally, when they had to
      chastise some turbulent tribe, or to give some ill-guarded town to the
      flames.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">

      It would be a difficult task to define with any approach to accuracy the
      distribution of the Canaanites, Amorites, and Aramæans, and to indicate
      the precise points where they came into contact with their rivals of
      non-Semitic stock. Frontiers between races and languages can never be very
      easily determined, and this is especially true of the peoples of Syria.
      They are so broken up and mixed in this region, that even in
      neighbourhoods where one predominant tribe is concentrated, it is easy to
      find at every step representatives of all the others. Four or five
      townships, singled out at random from the middle of a province, would
      often be found to belong to as many different races, and their respective
      inhabitants, while living within a distance of a mile or two, would be as
      great strangers to each other as if they were separated by the breadth of
      a continent.

      It would appear that the breaking up of these populations had not been
      carried so far in ancient as in modern times, but the confusion must
      already have been great if we are to judge from the number of different
      sites where we encounter evidences of people of the same language and
      blood. The bulk of the Khâti had not yet departed from the Taurus region,
      but some stray bands of them, carried away by the movement which led to
      the invasion of the Hyksôs, had settled around Hebron, where the rugged
      nature of the country served to protect them from their neighbours.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In very early times they are described as dwelling near
     Hebron or in the mountains of Judah. Since we have learned
     from the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments that the Khâti
     dwelt in Northern Syria, the majority of commentators have
     been indisposed to admit the existence of southern Hittites;
     this name, it is alleged, having been introduced into the
     Biblical around text through a misconception of the original
     documents, where the term Hittite was the equivalent of
     Canaanite.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Amorites* had their head-quarters Qodshul in Coele-Syria, but one
      section of them had taken up a position on the shores of the Lake of
      Tiberias in Galilee, others had established themselves within a short
      distance of Jaffa** on the Mediterranean, while others had settled in the
      neighbourhood of the southern Hittites in such numbers that their name in
      the Hebrew Scriptures was at times employed to designate the western
      mountainous region about the Dead Sea and the valley of the Jordan. Their
      presence was also indicated on the table-lands bordering the desert of
      Damascus, in the districts frequented by Bedouin of the tribe of Terah,
      Ammon and Moab, on the rivers Yarmuk and Jabbok, and at Edrei and
      Heshbon.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Ed. Meyer has established the fact that the term Amorite,
     as well as the parallel word Canaanite, was the designation
     of the inhabitants of Palestine before the arrival of the
     Hebrews: the former belonged to the prevailing tradition in
     the kingdom of Israel, the latter to that which was current
     in Judah. This view confirms the conclusion which may be
     drawn from the Egyptian monuments as to the power of
     expansion and the diffusion of the people.

     ** These were the Amorites which the tribe of Dan at a later
     period could not dislodge from the lands which had been

      The fuller, indeed, our knowledge is of the condition of Syria at the time
      of the Egyptian conquest, the more we are forced to recognise the mixture
      of races therein, and their almost infinite subdivisions. The mutual
      jealousies, however, of these elements of various origin were not so
      inveterate as to put an obstacle in the way, I will not say of political
      alliances, but of daily intercourse and frequent contracts. Owing to
      intermarriages between the tribes, and the continual crossing of the
      results of such unions, peculiar characteristics were at length
      eliminated, and a uniform type of face was the result. From north to south
      one special form of countenance, that which we usually call Semitic,
      prevailed among them.

      The Syrian and Egyptian monuments furnish us everywhere, under different
      ethnical names, with representations of a broad-shouldered people of high
      stature, slender-figured in youth, but with a fatal tendency to obesity in
      old age. Their heads are large, somewhat narrow, and artificially
      flattened or deformed, like those of several modern tribes in the Lebanon.
      Their high cheek-bones stand out from their hollow cheeks, and their blue
      or black eyes are buried under their enormous eyebrows. The lower part of
      the face is square and somewhat heavy, but it is often concealed by a
      thick and curly beard. The forehead is rather low and retreating, while
      the nose has a distinctly aquiline curve. The type is not on the whole so
      fine as the Egyptian, but it is not so heavy as that of the Chaldæans in
      the time of Gudea. The Theban artists have represented it in their
      battle-scenes, and while individualising every soldier or Asiatic prisoner
      with a happy knack so as to avoid monotony, they have with much
      intelligence impressed upon all of them the marks of a common parentage.

      One feels that the artists must have recognised them as belonging to one
      common family. They associated with their efforts after true and exact
      representation a certain caustic humour, which impelled them often to
      substitute for a portrait a more or less jocose caricature of their
      adversaries. On the walls of the Pylons, and in places where the majesty
      of a god restrained them from departing too openly from their official
      gravity, they contented themselves with exaggerating from panel to panel
      the contortions and pitiable expressions of the captive chiefs as they
      followed behind the triumphal chariot of the Pharaoh on his return from
      his Syrian campaigns.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An illustration of this will be found in the line of
     prisoners, brought by Seti I. from his great Asiatic
     campaign, which is depicted on the outer face of the north
     wall of the hypostyle at Karnak.
</pre>
    <p>
      Where religious scruples offered no obstacle they abandoned themselves to
      the inspiration of the moment, and gave themselves freely up to
      caricature. It is an Amorite or Canaanite&mdash;that thick-lipped,
      flat-nosed slave, with his brutal lower jaw and smooth conical skull&mdash;who
      serves for the handle of a spoon in the museum of the Louvre. The
      stupefied air with which he trudges under his burden is rendered in the
      most natural manner, and the flattening to which his forehead had been
      subjected in infancy is unfeelingly accentuated. The model which served
      for this object must have been intentionally brutalised and disfigured in
      order to excite the laughter of Pharaoh&rsquo;s subjects.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Dr. Regnault thinks that the head was artificially
     deformed in infancy: the bandage necessary to effect it must
     have been applied very low on the forehead in front, and to
     the whole occiput behind. If this is the case, the instance
     is not an isolated one, for a deformation of a similar
     character is found in the case of the numerous Semites
     represented on the tomb of Rakhmiri: a similar practice
     still obtains in certain parts of modern Syria.

      The idea of uniformity with which we are impressed when examining the
      faces of these people is confirmed and extended when we come to study
      their costumes. Men and women&mdash;we may say all Syrians according to
      their condition of life&mdash;had a choice between only two or three modes
      of dress, which, whatever the locality, or whatever the period, seemed
      never to change. On closer examination slight shades of difference in cut
      and arrangement may, however, be detected, and it may be affirmed that
      fashion ran even in ancient Syria through as many capricious evolutions as
      with ourselves; but these variations, which were evident to the eyes of
      the people of the time, are not sufficiently striking to enable us to
      classify the people, or to fix their date. The peasants and the lower
      class of citizens required no other clothing than a loin-cloth similar to
      that of the Egyptians,* or a shirt of a yellow or white colour, extending
      below the knees, and furnished with short sleeves. The opening for the
      neck was cruciform, and the hem was usually ornamented with coloured
      needlework or embroidery. The burghers and nobles wore over this a long
      strip of cloth, which, after passing closely round the hips and chest, was
      brought up and spread over the shoulders as a sort of cloak. This was not
      made of the light material used in Egypt, which offered no protection from
      cold or rain, but was composed of a thick, rough wool, like that employed
      in Chaldæa, and was commonly adorned with stripes or bands of colour, in
      addition to spots and other conspicuous designs.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Asiatic loin-cloth differs from the Egyptian in having
     pendent cords; the Syrian fellahin still wear it when at
     work.
</pre>
    <p>
      Rich and fashionable folk substituted for this cloth two large shawls&mdash;one
      red and the other blue&mdash;in which they dexterously arrayed themselves
      so as to alternate the colours: a belt of soft leather gathered the folds
      around the figure. Red morocco buskins, a soft cap, a handkerchief, a <i>kejfîyeh</i>
      confined by a fillet, and sometimes a wig after the Egyptian fashion,
      completed the dress.

      Beards were almost universal among the men, but the moustache was of rare
      occurrence. In many of the figures represented on the monuments we find
      that the head was carefully shaved, while in others the hair was allowed
      to grow, arranged in curls, frizzed and shining with oil or sweet-smelling
      pomade, sometimes thrown back behind the ears and falling on the neck in
      bunches or curly masses, sometimes drawn out in stiff spikes so as to
      serve as a projecting cover over the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women usually tired their hair in three great masses, of which the
      thickest was allowed to fall freely down the back; while the other two
      formed a kind of framework for the face, the ends descending on each side
      as far as the breast. Some of the women arranged their hair after the
      Egyptian manner, in a series of numerous small tresses, brought together
      at the ends so as to form a kind of plat, and terminating in a flower made
      of metal or enamelled terracotta. A network of glass ornaments, arranged
      on a semicircle of beads, or on a background of embroidered stuff, was
      frequently used as a covering for the top of the head.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Examples of Syrian feminine costume are somewhat rare on
     the Egyptian monuments. In the scenes of the capturing of
     towns we see a few. Here the women are represented on the
     walls imploring the mercy of the besieger. Other figures are
     those of prisoners being led captive into Egypt.

      The shirt had no sleeves, and the fringed garment which covered it left
      half of the arm exposed. Children of tender years had their heads shaved,
      as a head-dress, and rejoiced in no more clothing than the little ones
      among the Egyptians. With the exception of bracelets, anklets, rings on
      the fingers, and occasionally necklaces and earrings, the Syrians, both
      men and women, wore little jewellery. The Chaldæa women furnished them
      with models of fashion to which they accommodated themselves in the choice
      of stuffs, colours, cut of their mantles or petticoats, arrangement of the
      hair, and the use of cosmetics for the eyes and cheeks. In spite of
      distance, the modes of Babylon reigned supreme. The Syrians would have
      continued to expose their right shoulder to the weather as long as it
      pleased the people of the Lower Euphrates to do the same; but as soon as
      the fashion changed in the latter region, and it became customary to cover
      the shoulder, and to wrap the upper part of the person in two or three
      thicknesses of heavy wool, they at once accommodated themselves to the new
      mode, although it served to restrain the free motion of the body. Among
      the upper classes, at least, domestic arrangements were modelled upon the
      fashions observed in the palaces of the nobles of Car-chemish or Assur:
      the same articles of toilet, the same ranks of servants and scribes, the
      same luxurious habits, and the same use of perfumes were to be found among
      both.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An example of the fashion of leaving the shoulder bare is
     found even in the XXth dynasty. The Tel el-Amarna tablets
     prove that, as far as the scribes were concerned, the
     customs and training of Syria and Chaldæa were identical.
     The Syrian princes are there represented as employing the
     cuneiform character in their correspondence, being
     accompanied by scribes brought up after the Chaldæan manner.
     We shall see later on that the king of the Khati, who
     represented in the time of Ramses II. the type of an
     accomplished Syrian, had attendants similar to those of the
     Chaldæan kings.
</pre>
    <p>
      From all that we can gather, in short, from the silence as well as from
      the misunderstandings of the Egyptian chroniclers, Syria stands before us
      as a fruitful and civilized country, of which one might be thankful to be
      a native, in spite of continual wars and frequent revolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The religion of the Syrians was subject to the same influences as their
      customs; we are, as yet, far from being able to draw a complete picture of
      their theology, but such knowledge as we do possess recalls the same names
      and the same elements as are found in the religious systems of Chaldæa.
      The myths, it is true, are still vague and misty, at least to our modern
      ideas: the general characteristics of the principal divinities alone stand
      out, and seem fairly well defined. As with the other Semitic races, the
      deity in a general sense, the primordial type of the godhead, was called
      <i>El</i> or <i>Ilû</i>, and his feminine counterpart <i>Ilât</i>, but we
      find comparatively few cities in which these nearly abstract beings
      enjoyed the veneration of the faithful.* The gods of Syria, like those of
      Egypt and of the countries watered by the Euphrates, were feudal princes
      distributed over the surface of the earth, their number corresponding with
      that of the independent states. Each nation, each tribe, each city,
      worshipped its own lord&mdash;<i>Adoni</i>** &mdash;or its master&mdash;<i>Baal</i>***
      &mdash;and each of these was designated by a special title to distinguish
      him from neighbouring <i>Baalîm</i>, or masters.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The frequent occurrence of the term <i>Ilû</i> or <i>El</i> in names
     of towns in Southern Syria seems to indicate pretty
     conclusively that the inhabitants of these countries used
     this term by preference to designate their supreme god.
     Similarly we meet with it in Aramaic names, and later on
     among the Nabathseans; it predominates at Byblos and Berytus
     in Phoenicia and among the Aramaic peoples of North Syria;
     in the Samalla country, for instance, during the VIIIth
     century B.C.

     ** The extension of this term to Syrian countries is proved
     in the Israelitish epoch by Canaanitish names, such as
     Adonizedek and Adonibezek, or Jewish names such as Adonijah,
     Adonikam, Adoniram-Adoram.

     *** Movers tried to prove that there was one particular god
     named Baal, and his ideas, popularised in Prance by M. de
     Vogiié, prevailed for some time: since then scholars have
     gone back to the view of Münter and of the writers at the
     beginning of this century, who regarded the term Baal as a
     common epithet applicable to all gods.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Baal who ruled at Zebub was styled &ldquo;Master of Zebub,&rdquo; or Baal-Zebub;*
      and the Baal of Hermon, who was an ally of Gad, goddess of fortune, was
      sometimes called Baal-Hermon, or &ldquo;Master of Hermon,&rdquo; sometimes Baal-G-ad,
      or &ldquo;Master of Gad;&rdquo; ** the Baal of Shechem, at the time of the Israelite
      invasion, was &ldquo;Master of the Covenant&rdquo;&mdash;Baal-Berîth&mdash;doubtless
      in memory of some agreement which he had concluded with his worshippers in
      regard to the conditions of their allegiance.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Baal-Zebub was worshipped at Ekxon during the Philistine
     supremacy.

     ** The mountain of Baal-Hermon is the mountain of Baniâs,
     where the Jordan has one of its sources, and the town of
     Baal-Hermon is Baniâs itself. The variant Baal-Gad occurs
     several times in the Biblical books.

     *** Baal-Berith, like Baal-Zebub, only occurs, so far as we
     know at present, in the Hebrew Scriptures, where, by the
     way, the first element, Baal, is changed to El, El-Berith.

      The prevalent conception of the essence and attributes of these deities
      was not the same in all their sanctuaries, but the more exalted among them
      were regarded as personifying the sky in the daytime or at night, the
      atmosphere, the light,* or the sun, Shamash, as creator and prime mover of
      the universe; and each declared himself to be king&mdash;<i>melek</i>&mdash;over
      the other gods.** Bashuf represented the lightning and the thunderbolt;***
      Shalmân, Hadad, and his double Bimmôn held sway over the air like the
      Babylonian.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This appears under the name <i>Or</i> or <i>Ur</i> in the Samalla
     inscriptions of the VIIIth century B.C.; it is, so far, a
     unique instance among the Semites.

     ** We find the term applied in the Bible to the national god
     of the Ammonites, under the forms <i>Moloch, Molech, Mikôm,
     Milkâm</i>, and especially with the article, <i>Ham-molek</i>; the
     real name hidden beneath this epithet was probably <i>Amnôn or
     Ammân</i>, and, strictly speaking, the God Moloch only exists
     in the imagination of scholars. The epithet was used among
     the Oanaanites in the name Melchizedek, a similar form to
     Adonizedek, Abimelech, Ahimelech; it was in current use
     among the Phoenicians, in reference to the god of Tyre,
     Melek-Karta or Melkarth, and in many proper names, such as
     Melekiathon, Baalmelek, Bodmalek, etc., not to mention the
     god Milichus worshipped in Spain, who was really none other
     than Melkarth.

     *** Resheph has been vocalised <i>Rashuf</i> in deference to the
     Egyptian orthography Rashupu. It was a name common to a
     whole family of lightning and storm-gods, and M. de Rougé
     pointed out long ago the passage in the Great Inscription of
     Ramses III. at Medinet-Habu, in which the soldiers who man
     the chariots are compared to the Rashupu; the Rabbinic
     Hebrew still employs this plural form in the sense of
     &ldquo;demons.&rdquo; The Phoenician inscriptions contain references to
     several local Rashufs; the way in which this god is coupled
     with the goddess Qodshu on the Egyptian stelæ leads me to
     think that, at the epoch now under consideration, he was
     specially worshipped by the Amorites, just as his equivalent
     Hadad was by the inhabitants of Damascus, neighbours of the
     Amorites, and perhaps themselves Amorites.
</pre>
    <p>
      Rammânu;* Dagon, patron god of fishermen and husbandmen, seems to have
      watched over the fruitfulness of the sea and the land.** We are beginning
      to learn the names of the races whom they specially protected: Rashuf the
      Amorites, Hadad and Rimmon the Aramæans of Damascus, Dagon the peoples of
      the coast between Ashkelon and the forest of Carmel. Rashûf is the only
      one whose appearance is known to us. He possessed the restless temperament
      usually attributed to the thunder-gods, and was, accordingly, pictured as
      a soldier armed with javelin and mace, bow and buckler; a gazelle&rsquo;s head
      with pointed horns surmounts his helmet, and sometimes, it may be, serves
      him as a cap.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Hadad and Rimmon are represented in Assyrio-Chaldæan by
     one and the same ideogram, which may be read either Dadda-
     Hadad or Eammânu. The identity of the expressions employed
     shows how close the connection between the two divinities
     must have been, even if they were not similar in all
     respects; from the Hebrew writings we know of the temple of
     Rimmon at Damascus (<i>2 Kings</i> v. 18) and that one of the
     kings of that city was called Tabrimmôn = &ldquo;llimmon is good&rdquo;
      (<i>1 Kings</i> xv. 18), while Hadad gave his name to no less
     than ten kings of the same city. Even as late as the Græco-
     Roman epoch, kingship over the other gods was still
     attributed both to Rimmon and to Hadad, but this latter was
     identified with the sun.

     ** The documents which we possess in regard to Dagon date
     from the Hebrew epoch, and represent him as worshipped by
     the Philistines. We know, however, from the Tel el-Amarna
     tablets, of a Dagantakala, a name which proves the presence
     of the god among the Canaanites long before the Philistine
     invasion, and we find two Beth-Dagons&mdash;one in the plain of
     Judah, the other in the tribe of Asher; Philo of Byblos
     makes Dagon a Phoenician deity, and declares him to be the
     genius of fecundity, master of grain and of labour. The
     representation of his statue which appears on the Græco-
     Roman coins of Abydos, reminds us of the fish-god of
     Chaldæa.
</pre>
    <p>
      Each god had for his complement a goddess, who was proclaimed &ldquo;mistress&rdquo;
       of the city, <i>Baalat</i>, or &ldquo;queen,&rdquo; <i>Milkat</i>, of heaven, just as
      the god himself was recognised as &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;king.&rdquo; * As a rule, the
      goddess was contented with the generic name of Astartê; but to this was
      often added some epithet, which lent her a distinct personality, and
      prevented her from being confounded with the Astartês of neighbouring
      cities, her companions or rivals.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Among goddesses to whom the title &ldquo;Baalat &ldquo;was referred,
     we have the goddess of Byblos, Baalat-Gebal, also the
     goddess of Berytus, Baalat-Berîth, or Beyrut. The epithet
     &ldquo;queen of heaven &ldquo;is applied to the Phoenician Astartê by
     Hebrew (<i>Jer.</i> vii. 18, xliv. 18-29) and classic writers.
     The Egyptians, when they adopted these Oanaanitish
     goddesses, preserved the title, and called each of them
     <i>nibît pit,</i> &ldquo;lady of heaven.&rdquo; In the Phoenician inscriptions
     their names are frequently preceded by the word <i>Rabbat:
     rabbat Baalat-Gebal</i>, &ldquo;(my) lady Baalat-Gebal.&rdquo;

     ** The Hebrew writers frequently refer to the Canaanite
     goddesses by the general title &ldquo;the Ashtarôth&rdquo; or &ldquo;Astartês,&rdquo;
      and a town in Northern Syria bore the significant name of
     Istarâti = &ldquo;the Ishtars, the Ashtarôth,&rdquo; a name which finds
     a parallel in Anathôth = &ldquo;the Anats,&rdquo; a title assumed by a
     town of the tribe of Benjamin; similarly, the Assyrio-
     Chaldæans called their goddesses by the plural of Ishtar.
     The inscription on an Egyptian amulet in the Louvre tells us
     of a personage of the XXth dynasty, who, from his name,
     Rabrabîna, must have been of Syrian origin, and who styled
     himself &ldquo;Prophet of the Astartês,&rdquo; Honnutir Astiratu.

      Thus she would be styled the &ldquo;good&rdquo; Astartê, Ashtoreth Naamah, or the

      appears on her forehead, as a sort of head-dress.* She was the goddess of

     monument called by the Arabs &ldquo;the stone of Job,&rdquo; which was
     discovered by M. Schumacher in the centre of the Hauran. It
     was an analogous goddess whom the Egyptians sometimes
     identified with their Hâthor, and whom they represented as
     crowned with a crescent.

     ** Gad, the goddess of fortune, is mainly known to us in
     connection with the Aramæans; we find mention made of her by
     the Hebrew writers, and geographical names, such as Baal-Gad
     and Migdol-Gad, prove that she must have been worshipped at
     a very early date in the Canaanite countries.

     *** Anat, or Anaîti, or Aniti, has been found in a
     Phoenician inscription, which enables us to reconstruct the
     history of the goddess. Her worship was largely practised
     among the Canaanites, as is proved by the existence in the
     Hebrew epoch of several towns, such as Beth-Anath, Beth-
     Anoth, Anathôth; at least one of which, Bît-Anîti, is
     mentioned in the Egyptian geographical lists. The appearance
     of Anat-Anîti is known to us, as she is represented in
     Egyptian dress on several stelæ of the XIXth and XXth
     dynasties. Her name, like that of Astartê, had become a
     generic term, in the plural form Anathôth, for a whole group
     of goddesses.

     **** Asîti is represented at Radesieh, on a stele of the
     time of Seti I.; she enters into the composition of a
     compound name, <i>Asîtiiàkhûrû</i> (perhaps &ldquo;the goddess of Asiti
     is enflamed with anger &ldquo;), which we find on a monument in
     the Vienna Museum. W. Max Müller makes her out to have been
     a divinity of the desert, and the place in which the picture
     representing her was found would seem to justify this
     hypothesis; the Egyptians connected her, as well as the
     other Astartês, with Sit-Typhon, owing to her cruel and
     warlike character.

      The statues sometimes represent her as a sphinx with a woman&rsquo;s head, but
      more often as a woman standing on a lion passant, either nude, or
      encircled round the hips by merely a girdle, her hands filled with flowers
      or with serpents, her features framed in a mass of heavy tresses&mdash;a
      faithful type of the priestesses who devoted themselves to her service,
      the <i>Qedeshôt</i>. She was the goddess of love in its animal, or rather
      in its purely physical, aspect, and in this capacity was styled Qaddishat
      the Holy, like the hetairæ of her family; Qodshu, the Amorite capital, was
      consecrated to her service, and she was there associated with Rashuf, the
      thunder-god.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Qaddishat is know to us from the Egyptian monuments
     referred to above. The name was sometimes written Qodshû,
     like that of the town: E. de Bougé argued from this that
     Qaddishat must have been the eponymous divinity of Qodshû,
     and that her real name was Kashit or Kesh; he recalls,
     however, the <i>rôle</i> played by the Qedeshoth, and admits that
     &ldquo;the Holy here means the prostitute.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      But she often comes before us as a warlike Amazon, brandishing a club,
      lance, or shield, mounted on horseback like a soldier, and wandering
      through the desert in quest of her prey.* This dual temperament rendered
      her a goddess of uncertain attributes and of violent contrasts; at times
      reserved and chaste, at other times shameless and dissolute, but always
      cruel, always barren, for the countless multitude of her excesses for ever
      shut her out from motherhood: she conceives without ceasing, but never
      brings forth children.** The Baalim and Astartês frequented by choice the
      tops of mountains, such as Lebanon, Carmel, Hermon, or Kasios:*** they
      dwelt near springs, or hid themselves in the depths of forests.**** They
      revealed themselves to mortals through the heavenly bodies, and in all the
      phenomena of nature: the sun was a Baal, the moon was Astartê, and the
      whole host of heaven was composed of more or less powerful genii, as we
      find in Chaldæa.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A fragment of a popular tale preserved in the British
     Museum, and mentioned by Birch, seems to show us Astartê in
     her character of war-goddess, and the sword of Astartê is
     mentioned by Chabas. A bas-relief at Edfû represents her
     standing upright in her chariot, drawn by horses, and
     trampling her enemies underfoot: she is there identified
     with Sokhît the warlike, destroyer of men.

     ** This conception of the Syrian goddesses had already
     become firmly established at the period with which we are
     dealing, for an Egyptian magical formula defines Anîti and
     Astartê as &ldquo;the great goddesses who conceiving do not bring
     forth young, for the Horuses have sealed them and Sit hath
     established them.&rdquo;

     *** The Baal of Lebanon is mentioned in an archaic
     Phoenician inscription, and the name &ldquo;Holy Cape&rdquo; (<i>Rosh-
     Qodshu</i>), borne in the time of Thûtmosis III. either by
     Haifa or by a neighbouring town, proves that Carmel was held
     sacred as far back as the Egyptian epoch. Baal-Hermon has
     already been mentioned.

     **** The source of the Jordan, near Baniâs, was the seat of
     a Baal whom the Greeks identified with Pan. This was
     probably the Baal-Gad who often lent his name to the
     neighbouring town of Baal-Hermon: many of the rivers of
     Phoenicia were called after the divinities worshipped in the
     nearest city, e.g. the Adonis, the Bêlos, the Asclepios, the
     Damûras.
</pre>
    <p>
      They required that offerings and prayers should be brought to them at the
      high places,* but they were also pleased&mdash;and especially the
      goddesses&mdash;to lodge in trees; tree-trunks, sometimes leafy, sometimes
      bare and branchless (<i>ashêrah</i>), long continued to be living emblems
      of the local Astartês among the peoples of Southern Syria. Side by side
      with these plant-gods we find everywhere, in the inmost recesses of the
      temples, at cross-roads, and in the open fields, blocks of stone hewn into
      pillars, isolated boulders, or natural rocks, sometimes of meteoric
      origin, which were recognised by certain mysterious marks to be the house
      of the god, the Betyli or Beth-els in which he enclosed a part of his
      intelligence and vital force.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * These are the &ldquo;high places&rdquo; (bamôth) so frequently
     referred to by the Hebrew prophets, and which we find in the
     country of Moab, according to the Mesha inscription, and in
     the place-name Bamoth-Baal; many of them seem to have served
     for Canaanitish places of worship before they were resorted
     to by the children of Israel.
</pre>
    <p>
      The worship of these gods involved the performance of ceremonies more
      bloody and licentious even than those practised by other races. The Baalim
      thirsted after blood, nor would they be satisfied with any common blood
      such as generally contented their brethren in Chaldæa or Egypt: they
      imperatively demanded human as well as animal sacrifices. Among several of
      the Syrian nations they had a prescriptive right to the firstborn male of
      each family;* this right was generally commuted, either by a money payment
      or by subjecting the infant to circumcision.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This fact is proved, in so far as the Hebrew people is
     concerned, by the texts of the Pentateuch and of the
     prophets; amongst the Moabites also it was his eldest son
     whom King Mosha took to offer to his god. We find the same
     custom among other Syrian races: Philo of Byblos tells us,
     in fact, that El-Kronos, god of Byblos, sacrificed his
     firstborn son and set the example of this kind of offering.

     ** Redemption by a payment in money was the case among the
     Hebrews, as also the substitution of an animal in the place
     of a child; as to redemption by circumcision, cf. the story
     of Moses and Zipporah, where the mother saves her son from
     Jahveh by circumcising him. Circumcision was practised among
     the Syrians of Palestine in the time of Herodotus.
</pre>
    <p>
      At important junctures, however, this pretence of bloodshed would fail to
      appease them, and the death of the child alone availed. Indeed, in times
      of national danger, the king and nobles would furnish, not merely a single
      victim, but as many as the priests chose to demand.* While they were being
      burnt alive on the knees of the statue, or before the sacred emblem, their
      cries of pain were drowned by the piping of flutes or the blare of
      trumpets, the parents standing near the altar, without a sign of pity, and
      dressed as for a festival: the ruler of the world could refuse nothing to
      prayers backed by so precious an offering, and by a purpose so determined
      to move him. Such sacrifices were, however, the exception, and the
      shedding of their own blood by his priests sufficed, as a rule, for the
      daily wants of the god. Seizing their knives, they would slash their arms
      and breasts with the view of compelling, by this offering of their own
      persons, the good will of the Baalim.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * If we may credit Tertullian, the custom of offering up
     children as sacrifices lasted down to the proconsulate of
     Tiberius.

     ** Cf., for the Hebraic epoch, the scene where the priests
     of Baal, in a trial of power with Elijah before Ahab,
     offered up sacrifices on the highest point of Carmel, and
     finding that their offerings did not meet with the usual
     success, &ldquo;cut themselves... with knives and lancets till the
     blood gushed out upon them.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The Astartês of all degrees and kinds were hardly less cruel; they imposed
      frequent flagellations, self-mutilation, and sometimes even emasculation,
      on their devotees. Around the majority of these goddesses was gathered an
      infamous troop of profligates (<i>kedeshîm</i>), &ldquo;dogs of love&rdquo; (<i>kelabîm</i>),
      and courtesans (<i>kedeshôt</i>). The temples bore little resemblance to
      those of the regions of the Lower Euphrates: nowhere do we find traces of
      those <i>ziggurat</i> which serve to produce the peculiar jagged outline
      characteristic of Chaldæan cities. The Syrian edifices were stone
      buildings, which included, in addition to the halls and courts reserved
      for religious rites, dwelling-rooms for the priesthood, and storehouses
      for provisions: though not to be compared in size with the sanctuaries of
      Thebes, they yet answered the purpose of strongholds in time of need, and
      were capable of resisting the attacks of a victorious foe.* A numerous
      staff, consisting of priests, male and female singers, porters, butchers,
      slaves, and artisans, was assigned to each of these temples: here the god
      was accustomed to give forth his oracles, either by the voice of his
      prophets, or by the movement of his statues.** The greater number of the
      festivals celebrated in them were closely connected with the pastoral and
      agricultural life of the country; they inaugurated, or brought to a close,
      the principal operations of the year&mdash;the sowing of seed, the
      harvest, the vintage, the shearing of the sheep. At Shechem, when the
      grapes were ripe, the people flocked out of the town into the vineyards,
      returning to the temple for religious observances and sacred banquets when
      the fruit had been trodden in the winepress.***
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The story of Abimelech gives us some idea of what the
     Canaanite temple of Baal-Berîth at Shechem was like.

     ** As to the regular organisation of Baal-worship, we
     possess only documents of a comparatively late period.

     *** It is probable that the vintage festival, celebrated at
     Shiloh in the time of the Judges, dated back to a period of
     Canaanite history prior to the Hebrew invasion, i.e. to the
     time of the Egyptian supremacy.
</pre>
    <p>
      In times of extraordinary distress, such as a prolonged drought or a
      famine, the priests were wont to ascend in solemn procession to the high
      places in order to implore the pity of their divine masters, from whom
      they strove to extort help, or to obtain the wished-for rain, by their
      dances, their lamentations, and the shedding of their blood.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *Cf., in the Hebraic period, the scene where the priests of
     Baal go up to the top of Mount Carmel with the prophet
     Elijah.

    <p>
      Almost everywhere, but especially in the regions east of the Jordan, were
      monuments which popular piety surrounded with a superstitious reverence.
      Such were the isolated boulders, or, as we should call them, &ldquo;menhirs,&rdquo;
       reared on the summit of a knoll, or on the edge of a tableland; dolmens,
      formed of a flat slab placed on the top of two roughly hewn supports,
      cromlechs, or, that is to say, stone circles, in the centre of which might
      be found a beth-el. We know not by whom were set up these monuments there,
      nor at what time: the fact that they are in no way different from those
      which are to be met with in Western Europe and the north of Africa has
      given rise to the theory that they were the work of some one primeval race
      which wandered ceaselessly over the ancient world. A few of them may have
      marked the tombs of some forgotten personages, the discovery of human
      bones beneath them confirming such a conjecture; while others seem to have
      been holy places and altars from the beginning. The nations of Syria did
      not in all cases recognise the original purpose of these monuments, but
      regarded them as marking the seat of an ancient divinity, or the precise
      spot on which he had at some time manifested himself. When the children of
      Israel caught sight of them again on their return from Egypt, they at once
      recognised in them the work of their patriarchs. The dolmen at Shechem was
      the altar which Abraham had built to the Eternal after his arrival in the
      country of Canaan. Isaac had raised that at Beersheba, on the very spot
      where Jehovah had appeared in order to renew with him the covenant that He
      had made with Abraham. One might almost reconstruct a map of the
      wanderings of Jacob from the altars which he built at each of his
      principal resting-places&mdash;at Gilead [Galeed], at Ephrata, at Bethel,
      and at Shechem.* Each of such still existing objects probably had a
      history of its own, connecting it inseparably with some far-off event in
      the local annals.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The heap of stones at Galeed, in Aramaic <i>Jegar-
     Sahadutha</i>, &ldquo;the heap of witness,&rdquo; marked the spot where
     Laban and Jacob were reconciled; the stele on the way to
     Ephrata was the tomb of Rachel; the altar and stele at
     Bethel marked the spot where God appeared unto Jacob.

      Most of them were objects of worship: they were anointed with oil, and
      victims were slaughtered in their honour; the faithful even came at times
      to spend the night and sleep near them, in order to obtain in their dreams
      glimpses of the future.*

     * The menhir of Bethel was the identical one whereon Jacob
     rested his head on the night in which Jehovah appeared to
     him in a dream. In Phoenicia there was a legend which told

     the chase as a libation.

      Men and beasts were supposed to be animated, during their lifetime, by a
      breath or soul which ran in their veins along with their blood, and served
      to move their limbs; the man, therefore, who drank blood or ate bleeding
      flesh assimilated thereby the soul which inhered in it. After death the
      fate of this soul was similar to that ascribed to the spirits of the
      departed in Egypt and Chaldæa. The inhabitants of the ancient world were
      always accustomed to regard the surviving element in man as something
      restless and unhappy&mdash;a weak and pitiable double, doomed to hopeless
      destruction if deprived of the succour of the living. They imagined it as
      taking up its abode near the body wrapped in a half-conscious lethargy; or
      else as dwelling with the other <i>rephaim</i> (departed spirits) in some
      dismal and gloomy kingdom, hidden in the bowels of the earth, like the
      region ruled by the Chaldæan Allât, its doors gaping wide to engulf new
      arrivals, but allowing none to escape who had once passed the threshold.*

      There it wasted away, a prey to sullen melancholy, under the sway of

      his former master, the rich man no longer possessed anything which could
      raise him above the poor, and dreaded monarchs were greeted on their

      The corpse, after it had been anointed with perfumes and enveloped in
      linen, and impregnated with substances which retarded its decomposition,
      was placed in some natural grotto or in a cave hollowed out of the solid
      rock: sometimes it was simply laid on the bare earth, sometimes in a
      sarcophagus or coffin, and on it, or around it, were piled amulets,
      jewels, objects of daily use, vessels filled with perfume, or household
      utensils, together with meat and drink. The entrance was then closed, and
      on the spot a cippus was erected&mdash;in popular estimation sometimes
      held to represent the soul&mdash;or a monument was set up on a scale
      proportionate to the importance of the family to which the dead man had
      belonged.* On certain days beasts ceremonially pure were sacrificed at the
      tomb, and libations poured out, which, carried into the next world by
      virtue of the prayers of those who offered them, and by the aid of the
      gods to whom the prayers were addressed, assuaged the hunger and thirst of
      the dead man.** The chapels and stellæ which marked the exterior of these
      &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; *** houses have disappeared in the course of the various wars by
      which Syria suffered so heavily: in almost all cases, therefore, we are
      ignorant as to the sites of the various cities of the dead in which the
      nobles and common people of the Canaanite and Amorite towns were laid to
      rest.****

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The pillar or stele was used among both Hebrews and
     Phoenicians to mark the graves of distinguished persons.
     Among the Semites speaking Aramaic it was called <i>nephesh</i>,
     especially when it took the form of a pyramid; the word
     means &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; &ldquo;soul,&rdquo; and clearly shows the ideas
     associated with the object.

     ** An altar was sometimes placed in front of the sarcophagus
     to receive these offerings.

     *** This expression, which is identical with that used by
     the Egyptians of the same period, is found in one of the
     Phoenician inscriptions at Malta.

     **** The excavations carried out by M. Gautier in 1893-94,
     on the little island of Bahr-el-Kadis, at one time believed
     to have been the site of the town of Qodshu, have revealed
     the existence of a number of tombs in the enclosure which
     forms the central part of the tumulus: some of these may
     possibly date from the Amorite epoch, but they are very poor
     in remains, and contain no object which permits us to fix
     the date with accuracy.

      In Phoenicia alone do we meet with burial-places which, after the
      vicissitudes and upheavals of thirty centuries, still retain something of
      their original arrangement. Sometimes the site chosen was on level ground:
      perpendicular shafts or stairways cut in the soil led down to low-roofed
      chambers, the number of which varied according to circumstances: they were
      often arranged in two stories, placed one above the other, fresh vaults
      being probably added as the old ones were filled up. They were usually
      rectangular in shape, with horizontal or slightly arched ceilings; niches
      cut in the walls received the dead body and the objects intended for its
      use in the next world, and were then closed with a slab of stone.
      Elsewhere some isolated hill or narrow gorge, with sides of fine
      homogeneous limestone, was selected.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Such was the necropolis at Adlûn, the last rearrangement
     of which took place during the Græco-Roman period, but
     which externally bears so strong a resemblance to an
     Egyptian necropolis of the XVIIIth or XIXth dynasty, that we
     may, without violating the probabilities, trace its origin
     back to the time of the Pharaonic conquest.
</pre>
    <p>
      In this case the doors were placed in rows on a sort of façade similar to
      that of the Egyptian rock-tomb, generally without any attempt at external
      ornament. The vaults were on the ground-level, but were not used as
      chapels for the celebration of festivals in honour of the dead: they were
      walled up after every funeral, and all access to them forbidden, until
      such time as they were again required for the purposes of burial. Except
      on these occasions of sad necessity, those whom &ldquo;the mouth of the pit had
      devoured&rdquo; dreaded the visits of the living, and resorted to every means
      afforded by their religion to protect themselves from them. Their
      inscriptions declare repeatedly that neither gold nor silver, nor any
      object which could excite the greed of robbers, was to be found within
      their graves; they threaten any one who should dare to deprive them of
      such articles of little value as belonged to them, or to turn them out of
      their chambers in order to make room for others, with all sorts of
      vengeance, divine and human. These imprecations have not, however, availed
      to save them from the desecration the danger of which they foresaw, and
      there are few of their tombs which were not occupied by a succession of
      tenants between the date of their first making and the close of the Roman
      supremacy. When the modern explorer chances to discover a vault which has
      escaped the spade of the treasure-seeker, it is hardly ever the case that
      the bodies whose remains are unearthed prove to be those of the original
      proprietors.

      The gods and legends of Chaldæa had penetrated to the countries of Amauru
      and Canaan, together with the language of the conquerors and their system
      of writing: the stories of Adapa&rsquo;s struggles against the south-west wind,
      or of the incidents which forced Irishkigal, queen of the dead, to wed
      Nergal, were accustomed to be read at the courts of Syrian princes.
      Chaldæan theology, therefore, must have exercised influence on individual
      Syrians and on their belief; but although we are forced to allow the
      existence of such influence, we cannot define precisely the effects
      produced by it. Only on the coast and in the Phoenician cities do the
      local religions seem to have become formulated at a fairly early date, and
      crystallised under pressure of this influence into cosmogonie theories.
      The Baalim and Astartês reigned there as on the banks of the Jordan or
      Orontes, and in each town Baal was &ldquo;the most high,&rdquo; master of heaven and
      eternity, creator of everything which exists, though the character of his
      creating acts was variously defined according to time and place. Some
      regarded him as the personification of Justice, Sydyk, who established the
      universe with the help of eight indefatigable Cabiri. Others held the
      whole world to be the work of a divine family, whose successive
      generations gave birth to the various elements. The storm-wind, Colpias,
      wedded to Chaos, had begotten two mortals, Ulom (Time) and Kadmôn (the
      First-Born), and these in their turn engendered Qên and Qênath, who dwelt
      in Phoenicia: then came a drought, and they lifted up their heads to the
      Sun, imploring him, as Lord of the Heavens (<i>Baalsamîn</i>), to put an
      end to their woes. At Tyre it was thought that Chaos existed at the
      beginning, but chaos of a dark and troubled nature, over which a Breath (<i>rûakh</i>)
      floated without affecting it; &ldquo;and this Chaos had no ending, and it was
      thus for centuries and centuries.&mdash;Then the Breath became enamoured
      of its own principles, and brought about a change in itself, and this
      change was called Desire:&mdash;now Desire was the principle which created
      all things, and the Breath knew not its own creation.&mdash;The Breath and
      Chaos, therefore, became united, and Mot the Clay was born, and from this
      clay sprang all the seed of creation, and Mot was the father of all
      things; now Mot was like an egg in shape.&mdash;And the Sun, the Moon, the
      stars, the great planets, shone forth.* There were living beings devoid of
      intelligence, and from these living beings came intelligent beings, who
      were called <i>Zophesamîn</i>, or &lsquo;watchers of the heavens.&lsquo;Now the
      thunder-claps in the war of separating elements awoke these intelligent
      beings as it were from a sleep, and then the males and the females began
      to stir themselves and to seek one another on the land and in the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mot, the clay formed by the corruption of earth and water,
     is probably a Phoenician form of a word which means <i>water</i>
     in the Semitic languages. Cf. the Egyptian theory, according
     to which the clay, heated by the sun, was supposed to have
     given birth to animated beings; this same clay modelled by
     Khnûmû into the form of an egg was supposed to have produced
     the heavens and the earth.

      A scholar of the Roman epoch, Philo of Byblos, using as a basis some old
      documents hidden away in the sanctuaries, which had apparently been
      classified by Sanchoniathon, a priest long before his time, has handed
      these theories of the cosmogony down to us: after he has explained how the
      world was brought out of Chaos, he gives a brief summary of the dawn of
      civilization in Phoenicia and the legendary period in its history. No
      doubt he interprets the writings from which he compiled his work in
      accordance with the spirit of his time: he has none the less preserved
      their substance more or less faithfully. Beneath the veneer of abstraction
      with which the Greek tongue and mind have overlaid the fragment thus
      quoted, we discern that groundwork of barbaric ideas which is to be met
      with in most Oriental theologies, whether Egyptian or Babylonian. At first
      we have a black mysterious Chaos, stagnating in eternal waters, the
      primordial Nû or Apsû; then the slime which precipitates in this chaos and
      clots into the form of an egg, like the mud of the Nile under the hand? of
      Khnûmû; then the hatching forth of living organisms and indolent
      generations of barely conscious creatures, such as the Lakhmû, the Anshar,
      and the Illinu of Chaldæan speculation; finally the abrupt appearance of
      intelligent beings.

      The Phoenicians, however, accustomed as they were to the Mediterranean,
      with its blind outbursts of fury, had formed an idea of Chaos which
      differed widely from that of most of the inland races, to whom it
      presented itself as something silent and motionless: they imagined it as
      swept by a mighty wind, which, gradually increasing to a roaring tempest,
      at length succeeded in stirring the chaos to its very depths, and in
      fertilizing its elements amidst the fury of the storm. No sooner had the
      earth been thus brought roughly into shape, than the whole family of the
      north winds swooped down upon it, and reduced it to civilized order. It
      was but natural that the traditions of a seafaring race should trace its
      descent from the winds.

      In Phoenicia the sea is everything: of land there is but just enough to
      furnish a site for a score of towns, with their surrounding belt of
      gardens. Mount Lebanon, with its impenetrable forests, isolated it almost
      entirely from Coele-Syria, and acted as the eastward boundary of the long
      narrow quadrangle hemmed in between the mountains and the rocky shore of
      the sea. At frequent intervals, spurs run out at right angles from the
      principal chain, forming steep headlands on the sea-front: these cut up
      the country, small to begin with, into five or six still smaller
      provinces, each one of which possessed from time immemorial its own
      independent cities, its own religion, and its own national history. To the
      north were the Zahi, a race half sailors, half husbandmen, rich, brave,
      and turbulent, ever ready to give battle to their neighbours, or rebel
      against an alien master, be he who he might. Arvad,* which was used by
      them as a sort of stronghold or sanctuary, was huddled together on an
      island some two miles from the coast: it was only about a thousand yards
      in circumference, and the houses, as though to make up for the limited
      space available for their foundations, rose to a height of five stories.
      An Astartê reigned there, as also a sea-Baal, half man, half fish, but not
      a trace of a temple or royal palace is now to be found.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name Arvad was identified in the Egyptian inscriptions
     by Birch, who, with Hincks, at first saw in the name a
     reference to the peoples of Ararat; Birch&rsquo;s identification,
     is now accepted by all Egyptologists. The name is written
     Aruada or Arada in the Tel el-Amarna tablets.

     ** The Arvad Astartê had been identified by the Egyptians
     with their goddess Bastît. The sea-Baal, who has been
     connected by some with Dagon of Askalon, is represented on
     the earliest Arvadian coins. He has a fish-like tail, the
     body and bearded head of a man, with an Assyrian headdress;
     on his breast we sometimes find a circular opening which
     seems to show the entrails.
</pre>
    <p>
      The whole island was surrounded by a stone wall, built on the outermost
      ledges of the rocks, which were levelled to form its foundation. The
      courses of the masonry were irregular, laid without cement or mortar of
      any kind. This bold piece of engineering served the double purpose of
      sea-wall and rampart, and was thus fitted to withstand alike the onset of
      hostile fleets and the surges of the Mediterranean.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The antiquity of the wall of Arvad, recognised by
     travellers of the last century, is now universally admitted
     by all archæologists.
</pre>
    <p>
      There was no potable water on the island, and for drinking purposes the
      inhabitants were obliged to rely on the fall of rain, which they stored in
      cisterns&mdash;still in use among their descendants. In the event of
      prolonged drought they were obliged to send to the mainland opposite; in
      time of war they had recourse to a submarine spring, which bubbles up in
      mid-channel. Their divers let down a leaden bell, to the top of which was
      fitted a leathern pipe, and applied it to the orifice of the spring; the
      fresh water coming up through the sand was collected in this bell, and
      rising in the pipe, reached the surface uncontaminated by salt water.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Renan tells us that &ldquo;M. Gaillardot, when crossing from the
     island to the mainland, noticed a spring of sweet water
     bubbling up from the bottom of the sea.... Thomson and
     Walpole noticed the same spring or similar springs a little
     to the north of Tortosa.&rdquo;

    <p>
      The harbour opened to the east, facing the mainland: it was divided into
      two basins by a stone jetty, and was doubtless insufficient for the
      sea-traffic, but this was the less felt inasmuch as there was a safe
      anchorage outside it&mdash;the best, perhaps, to be found in these waters.
      Opposite to Arvad, on an almost continuous line of coast some ten or
      twelve miles in length, towns and villages occurred at short intervals,
      such as Marath, Antarados, Enhydra, and Karnê, into which the surplus
      population of the island overflowed. Karnê possessed a harbour, and would
      have been a dangerous neighbour to the Arvadians had they themselves not
      occupied and carefully fortified it.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Marath, now Amrît, possesses some ancient ruins which have
     been described by Renan. Antarados, which prior to the
     Græco-Roman era was a place of no importance, occupies the
     site of Tortosa. Enhydra is not known, and Karnê has been
     replaced by Karnûn to the north of Tortosa. None of the
     &ldquo;neighbours of Arados&rdquo; are mentioned by name in the Assyrian
     texts; but W. Max Müller has demonstrated that the Egyptian
     form <i>Aratût</i> or <i>Aratiût</i> corresponds with a Semitic plural
     <i>Arvadôt</i>, and consequently refers not only to Arad itself,
     but also to the fortified cities and towns which formed its
     continental suburbs.
</pre>
    <p>
      The cities of the dead lay close together in the background, on the slope
      of the nearest chain of hills; still further back lay a plain celebrated
      for its fertility and the luxuriance of its verdure: Lebanon, with its
      wooded peaks, was shut in on the north and south, but on the east the
      mountain sloped downwards almost to the sea-level, furnishing a pass
      through which ran the road which joined the great military highway not far
      from Qodshu. The influence of Arvad penetrated by means of this pass into
      the valley of the Orontes, and is believed to have gradually extended as
      far as Hamath itself&mdash;in other words, over the whole of Zahi. For the
      most part, however, its rule was confined to the coast between G-abala and
      the Nahr el-Kebîr; Simyra at one time acknowledged its suzerainty, at
      another became a self-supporting and independent state, strong enough to
      compel the respect of its neighbours.* Beyond the Orontes, the coast
      curves abruptly inward towards the west, and a group of wind-swept hills
      ending in a promontory called Phaniel,** the reputed scene of a divine
      manifestation, marked the extreme limit of Arabian influence to the north,
      if, indeed, it ever reached so far.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Simyra is the modern Surnrah, near the Nahr el-Kebîr.

     ** The name has only come down to us under its Greek form,
     but its original form, Phaniel or Penûel, is easily arrived
     at from the analogous name used in Canaan to indicate
     localities where there had been a theophany. Renan questions
     whether Phaniel ought not to be taken in the same sense as
     the Pnê-Baal of the Carthaginian inscriptions, and applied
     to a goddess to whom the promontory had been dedicated; he
     also suggests that the modern name <i>Cap Madonne</i> may be a
     kind of echo of the title <i>Rabbath</i> borne by this goddess
     from the earliest times.
</pre>
    <p>
      Half a dozen obscure cities flourished here, Arka,* Siani,** Mahallat,
      Kaiz, Maîza, and Botrys,*** some of them on the seaboard, others inland on
      the bend of some minor stream. Botrys,**** the last of the six, barred the
      roads which cross the Phaniel headland, and commanded the entrance to the
      holy ground where Byblos and Berytus celebrated each year the amorous
      mysteries of Adonis.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Arka is perhaps referred to in the tablets of Tel el-
     Amarna under the form Irkata or Irkat; it also appears in
     the Bible (Gen. x. 17) and in the Assyrian texts. It is the
     Cassarea of classical geographers, which has now resumed its
     old Phoenician name of Tell-Arka.

     ** Sianu or Siani is mentioned in the Assyrian texts and in
     the Bible; Strabo knew it under the name of Sinna, and a
     village near Arka was called Sin or Syn as late as the XVth
     century.

     *** According to the Assyrian inscriptions, these were the
     names of the three towns which formed the Tripolis of
     Græco-Roman times.

     **** Botrys is the hellenized form of the name Bozruna or
     Bozrun, which appears on the tablets of Tel el-Amarna; the
     modern name, Butrun or Batrun, preserves the final letter
     which the Greeks had dropped.
</pre>
    <p>
      Gublu, or&mdash;as the Greeks named it&mdash;Byblos,* prided itself on
      being the most ancient city in the world. The god El had founded it at the
      dawning of time, on the flank of a hill which is visible from some
      distance out at sea. A small bay, now filled up, made it an important
      shipping centre. The temple stood on the top of the hill, a few fragments
      of its walls still serving to mark the site; it was, perhaps, identical
      with that of which we find the plan engraved on certain imperial coins.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * <i>Gublu</i> or <i>Gubli</i> is the pronunciation indicated for this
     name in the Tel el-Amarna tablets; the Egyptians transcribed
     it <i>Kupuna</i> or <i>Kupna</i> by substituting <i>n</i> for <i>l</i>. The
     Greek name Byblos was obtained from Gublu by substituting a
     <i>b</i> for the <i>g</i>.

     ** Renan carried out excavations in the hill of Kassubah
     which brought to light some remains of a Græco-Roman temple:
     he puts forward, subject to correction, the hypothesis which
     I have adopted above.
</pre>
    <p>
      Two flights of steps led up to it from the lower quarters of the town, one
      of which gave access to a chapel in the Greek style, surmounted by a
      triangular pediment, and dating, at the earliest, from the time of the
      Seleucides; the other terminated in a long colonnade, belonging to the
      same period, added as a new façade to an earlier building, apparently in
      order to bring it abreast of more modern requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sanctuary which stands hidden behind this incongruous veneer is, as
      represented on the coins, in a very archaic style, and is by no means
      wanting in originality or dignity. It consists of a vast rectangular court
      surrounded by cloisters. At the point where lines drawn from the centres
      of the two doors seem to cross one another stands a conical stone mounted
      on a cube of masonry, which is the beth-el animated by the spirit of the
      god: an open-work balustrade surrounds and protects it from the touch of
      the profane. The building was perhaps not earlier than the Assyrian or
      Persian era, but in its general plan it evidently reproduced the
      arrangements of some former edifice.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The author of the <i>De Deâ Syrâ</i> classed the temple of
     Byblos among the Phoenician temples of the old order, which
     were almost as ancient as the temples of Egypt, and it is
     probable that from the Egyptian epoch onwards the plan of
     this temple must have been that shown on the coins; the
     cloister arcades ought, however, to be represented by
     pillars or by columns supporting architraves, and the fact
     of their presence leads me to the conclusion that the temple
     did not exist in the form known to us at a date earlier than
     the last Assyrian period.
</pre>
    <p>
      At an early time El was spoken of as the first king of G-ablu in the same
      manner as each one of his Egyptian fellow-gods had been in their several
      nomes, and the story of his exploits formed the inevitable prelude to the
      beginning of human history. Grandson of Eliûn who had brought Chaos into
      order, son of Heaven and Earth, he dispossessed, vanquished, and mutilated
      his father, and conquered the most distant regions one after another&mdash;the
      countries beyond the Euphrates, Libya, Asia Minor and Greece: one year,
      when the plague was ravaging his empire, he burnt his own son on the altar
      as an expiatory victim, and from that time forward the priests took
      advantage of his example to demand the sacrifice of children in moments of
      public danger or calamity.

      He was represented as a man with two faces, whose eyes opened and shut in
      an eternal alternation of vigilance and repose: six wings grew from his
      shoulders, and spread fan-like around him. He was the incarnation of time,
      which destroys all things in its rapid flight; and of the summer sun,
      cruel and fateful, which eats up the green grass and parches the fields.
      An Astartê reigned with him over Byblos&mdash;Baalat-Gublu, his own
      sister; like him, the child of Earth and Heaven. In one of her aspects she
      was identified with the moon, the personification of coldness and
      chastity, and in her statues or on her sacred pillars she was represented
      with the crescent or cow-horns of the Egyptian Hâthor; but in her other
      aspect she appeared as the amorous and wanton goddess in whom the Greeks
      recognised the popular concept of Aphroditê. Tradition tells us how, one
      spring morning, she caught sight of and desired the youthful god known by
      the title of <i>Adoni</i>, or &ldquo;My Lord.&rdquo; We scarce know what to make of
      the origin of Adonis, and of the legends which treat him as a hero&mdash;the
      representation of him as the incestuous offspring of a certain King
      Kinyras and his own daughter Myrrha is a comparatively recent element
      grafted on the original myth; at any rate, the happiness of two lovers had
      lasted but a few short weeks when a sudden end was put to it by the tusks
      of a monstrous wild boar. Baalat-Gublu wept over her lover&rsquo;s body and
      buried it; then her grief triumphed over death, and Adonis, ransomed by
      her tears, rose from the tomb, his love no whit less passionate than it
      had been before the catastrophe. This is nothing else than the Chaldæan
      legend of Ishtar and Dûmûzi presented in a form more fully symbolical of
      the yearly marriage of Earth and Heaven. Like the Lady of Byblos at her
      master&rsquo;s approach, Earth is thrilled by the first breath of spring, and
      abandons herself without shame to the caresses of Heaven: she welcomes him
      to her arms, is fructified by him, and pours forth the abundance of her
      flowers and fruits. Them comes summer and kills the spring: Earth is burnt
      up and withers, she strips herself of her ornaments, and her fruitfulness
      departs till the gloom and icy numbness of winter have passed away. Each
      year the cycle of the seasons brings back with it the same joy, the same
      despair, into the life of the world; each year Baalat falls in love with
      her Adonis and loses him, only to bring him back to life and lose him
      again in the coming year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole neighbourhood of Byblos, and that part of Mount Lebanon in which
      it lies, were steeped in memories of this legend from the very earliest
      times. We know the precise spot where the goddess first caught sight of
      her lover, where she unveiled herself before him, and where at the last
      she buried his mutilated body, and chanted her lament for the dead. A
      river which flows southward not far off was called the Adonis, and the
      valley watered by it was supposed to have been the scene of this tragic
      idyll. The Adonis rises near Aphaka,* at the base of a narrow
      amphitheatre, issuing from the entrance of an irregular grotto, the
      natural shape of which had, at some remote period, been altered by the
      hand of man; in three cascades it bounds into a sort of circular basin,
      where it gathers to itself the waters of the neighbouring springs, then it
      dashes onwards under the single arch of a Roman bridge, and descends in a
      series of waterfalls to the level of the valley below.

     * Aphaka means &ldquo;spring&rdquo; in Syriac. The site of the temple and
     town of Aphaka, where a temple of Aphroditê and Adonis still
     stood in the time of the Emperor Julian, had long been
     identified either with Fakra, or with El-Yamuni. Seetzen was
     the first to place it at El-Afka, and his proposed
     identification has been amply confirmed by the researches of
     Penan.

      The temple rises opposite the source of the stream on an artificial mound,
      a meteorite fallen from heaven having attracted the attention of the
      faithful to the spot. The mountain falls abruptly away, its summit
      presenting a red and bare appearance, owing to the alternate action of
      summer sun and winter frost. As the slopes approach the valley they become
      clothed with a garb of wild vegetation, which bursts forth from every
      fissure, and finds a foothold on every projecting rock: the base of the
      mountain is hidden in a tangled mass of glowing green, which the moist yet
      sunny Spring calls forth in abundance whenever the slopes are not too
      steep to retain a shallow layer of nourishing mould. It would be hard to
      find, even among the most picturesque spots of Europe, a landscape in
      which wildness and beauty are more happily combined, or where the mildness
      of the air and sparkling coolness of the streams offer a more perfect
      setting for the ceremonies attending the worship of Astartê.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The temple had been rebuilt during the Roman period, as
     were nearly all the temples of this region, upon the site of
     a more ancient structure; this was probably the edifice
     which the author of <i>De Deâ Syrâ</i> considered to be the
     temple of Venus, built by Kinyras within a day&rsquo;s journey of
     Byblos in the Lebanon.

      In the basin of the river and of the torrents by which it is fed, there
      appears a succession of charming and romantic scenes&mdash;gaping chasms
      with precipitous ochre-coloured walls; narrow fields laid out in terraces
      on the slopes, or stretching in emerald strips along the ruddy
      river-banks; orchards thick with almond and walnut trees; sacred grottoes,
      into which the priestesses, seated at the corner of the roads, endeavour
      to draw the pilgrims as they proceed on their way to make their prayers to
      the goddess;* sanctuaries and mausolea of Adonis at Yanukh, on the
      table-land of Mashnaka, and on the heights of Ghineh. According to the
      common belief, the actual tomb of Adonis was to be found at Byblos
      itself,** where the people were accustomed to assemble twice a year to
      keep his festivals, which lasted for several days together.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Renan points out at Byblos the existence of one of these
     caverns which gave shelter to the <i>kedeshoth</i>. Many of the
     caves met with in the valley of the Nahr-Ibrahîm have
     doubtless served for the same purpose, although their walls
     contain no marks of the cult.

     ** Melito placed it, however, near Aphaka, and, indeed,
     there must have been as many different traditions on the
     subject as there were celebrated sanctuaries.

    <p>
      At the summer solstice, the season when the wild boar had ripped open the
      divine hunter, and the summer had already done damage to the spring, the
      priests were accustomed to prepare a painted wooden image of a corpse made
      ready for burial, which they hid in what were called the gardens of Adonis&mdash;terra-cotta
      pots filled with earth in which wheat and barley, lettuce and fennel, were
      sown. These were set out at the door of each house, or in the courts of
      the temple, where the sprouting plants had to endure the scorching effect
      of the sun, and soon withered away. For several days troops of women and
      young girls, with their heads dishevelled or shorn, their garments in
      rags, their faces torn with their nails, their breasts and arms scarified
      with knives, went about over hill and dale in search of their idol, giving
      utterance to cries of despair, and to endless appeals: &ldquo;Ah, Lord! Ah,
      Lord! what is become of thy beauty.&rdquo; Once having found the image, they
      brought it to the feet of the goddess, washed it while displaying its
      wound, anointed it with sweet-smelling unguents, wrapped it in a linen and
      woollen shroud, placed it on a catafalque, and, after expressing around
      the bier their feelings of desolation, according to the rites observed at
      fanerais, placed it solemnly in the tomb.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Theocritus has described in his fifth Idyll the laying out
     and burial of Adonis as it was practised at Alexandria in
     Egypt in the IIIrd century before our era.
</pre>
    <p>
      The close and dreary summer passes away. With the first days of September
      the autumnal rains begin to fall upon the hills, and washing away the
      ochreous earth lying upon the slopes, descend in muddy torrents into the
      hollows of the valleys. The Adonis river begins to swell with the ruddy
      waters, which, on reaching the sea, do not readily blend with it. The wind
      from the offing drives the river water back upon the coast, and forces it
      to cling for a long time to the shore, where it forms a kind of crimson
      fringe.* This was the blood of the hero, and the sight of this precious
      stream stirred up anew the devotion of the people, who donned once more
      their weeds of mourning until the priests were able to announce to them
      that, by virtue of their supplications, Adonis was brought back from the
      shades into new life. Shouts of joy immediately broke forth, and the
      people who had lately sympathized with the mourning goddess in her tears
      and cries of sorrow, now joined with her in expressions of mad and amorous
      delight. Wives and virgins&mdash;all the women who had refused during the
      week of mourning to make a sacrifice of their hair&mdash;were obliged to
      atone for this fault by putting themselves at the disposal of the
      strangers whom the festival had brought together, the reward of their
      service becoming the property of the sacred treasury.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The same phenomenon occurs in spring. Maundrell saw it on
     March 17, and Renan in the first days of February.

     ** A similar usage was found in later times in the countries
     colonised by or subjected to the influence of the
     Phoenicians, especially in Cyprus.
</pre>
    <p>
      Berytus shared with Byblos the glory of having had El for its founder.*
      The road which connects these two cities makes a lengthy detour in its
      course along the coast, having to cross numberless ravines and rocky
      summits: before reaching Palai-Byblos, it passes over a headland by a
      series of steps cut into the rock, forming a kind of &ldquo;ladder&rdquo; similar to
      that which is encountered lower down, between Acre and the plains of Tyre.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name Berytus was found by Hincks in the Egyptian texts
     under the form. Bîrutu, Beîrutu; it occurs frequently in the
     Tel el-Amarna tablets.
</pre>
    <p>
      The river Lykos runs like a kind of natural fosse along the base of this
      steep headland. It forms at the present time a torrent, fed by the melting
      snows of Mount Sannin, and is entirely unnavigable. It was better
      circumstanced formerly in this respect, and even in the early years of the
      Boman conquest, sailors from Arvad (Arados) were accustomed to sail up it
      as far as one of the passes of the lower Lebanon, leading into Cole-Syria.
      Berytus was installed at the base of a great headland which stands out
      boldly into the sea, and forms the most striking promontory to be met with
      in these regions from Carmel to the vicinity of Arvad. The port is nothing
      but an open creek with a petty roadstead, but it has the advantage of a
      good supply of fresh water, which pours down from the numerous springs to
      which it is indebted for its name.* According to ancient legends, it was
      given by El to one of his offspring called Poseidon by the Greeks.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The name Beyrut has been often derived from a Phconician
     word signifying <i>cypress</i>, and which may have been applied
     to the pine tree. The Phoenicians themselves derived it from
     Bîr, &ldquo;wells.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Adonis desired to take possession of it, but was frustrated in the
      attempt, and the maritime Baal secured the permanence of his rule by
      marrying one of his sisters&mdash;the Baalat-Beyrut who is represented as
      a nymph on Græco-Roman coins.* The rule of the city extended as far as the
      banks of the Tamur, and an old legend narrates that its patron fought in
      ancient times with the deity of that river, hurling stones at him to
      prevent his becoming master of the land to the north. The bar formed of
      shingle and the dunes which contract the entrance were regarded as
      evidences of this conflict.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The poet Nonnus has preserved a highly embellished account
     of this rivalry, where Adonis is called Dionysos.

     ** The original name appears to have been Tamur, Tamyr, from
     a word signifying &ldquo;palm&rdquo; in the Phoenician language. The
     myth of the conflict between Poseidon and the god of the
     river, a Baal-Demarous, has been explained by Renan, who
     accepts the identification of the river-deity with Baal-
     Thamar, already mentioned by Movers.

    <p>
      Beyond the southern bank of the river, Sidon sits enthroned as &ldquo;the
      firstborn of Canaan.&rdquo; In spite of this ambitious title it was at first
      nothing but a poor fishing village founded by Bel, the Agenor of the
      Greeks, on the southern slope of a spit of land which juts out obliquely
      towards the south-west.* It grew from year to year, spreading out over the
      plain, and became at length one of the most prosperous of the chief cities
      of the country&mdash;a &ldquo;mother&rdquo; in Phoenicia.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Sidon is called &ldquo;the firstborn of Canaan&rdquo; in Genesis: the
     name means a fishing-place, as the classical authors already
     knew&mdash;&ldquo;nam piscem Phonices <i>sidôn</i> appellant.&rdquo;

     ** In the coins of classic times it is called &ldquo;Sidon, the
     mother&mdash;<i>Om</i>&mdash;of Kambe, Hippo, Citium, and Tyre.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The port, once so celebrated, is shut in by three chains of half-sunken
      reefs, which, running out from the northern end of the peninsula, continue
      parallel to the coast for some hundreds of yards: narrow passages in these
      reefs afford access to the harbour; one small island, which is always
      above water, occupies the centre of this natural dyke of rocks, and
      furnishes a site for a maritime quarter opposite to the continental city.*
      The necropolis on the mainland extends to the east and north, and consists
      of an irregular series of excavations made in a low line of limestone
      cliffs which must have been lashed by the waves of the Mediterranean long
      prior to the beginning of history. These tombs are crowded closely
      together, ramifying into an inextricable maze, and are separated from each
      other by such thin walls that one expects every moment to see them give
      way, and bury the visitors in the ruin. Many date back to a very early
      period, while all of them have been re-worked and re-appropriated over and
      over again. The latest occupiers were contemporaries of the Macedonian
      kings or the Roman Cæsars. Space was limited and costly in this region of
      the dead: the Sidonians made the best use they could of the tombs, burying
      in them again and again, as the Egyptians were accustomed to do in their
      cemeteries at Thebes and Memphis. The surrounding plain is watered by the
      &ldquo;pleasant Bostrênos,&rdquo; and is covered with gardens which are reckoned to be
      the most beautiful in all Syria&mdash;at least after those of Damascus:
      their praises were sung even in ancient days, and they had then earned for
      the city the epithet of &ldquo;the flowery Sidon.&rdquo; **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The only description of the port which we possess is that
     in the romance of Olitophon and Leucippus by Achilles
     Tatius.

     ** The Bostrênos, which is perhaps to be recognised under
     the form Borinos in the Periplus of Scylax, is the modern
     Nahr el-Awaly.

    <p>
      Here, also, an Astartê ruled over the destinies of the people, but a
      chaste and immaculate Astartê, a self-restrained and warlike virgin,
      sometimes identified with the moon, sometimes with the pale and frigid
      morning star.* In addition to this goddess, the inhabitants worshipped a
      Baal-Sidon, and other divinities of milder character&mdash;an Astartê
      Shem-Baal, wife of the supreme Baal, and Eshmun, a god of medicine&mdash;each
      of whom had his own particular temple either in the town itself or in some
      neighbouring village in the mountain. Baal delighted in travel, and was
      accustomed to be drawn in a chariot through the valleys of Phoenicia in
      order to receive the prayers and offerings of his devotees. The immodest
      Astartê, excluded, it would seem, from the official religion, had her
      claims acknowledged in the cult offered to her by the people, but she
      became the subject of no poetic or dolorous legend like her namesake at
      Byblos, and there was no attempt to disguise her innately coarse character
      by throwing over it a garb of sentiment. She possessed in the suburbs her
      chapels and grottoes, hollowed out in the hillsides, where she was served
      by the usual crowd of <i>Ephébæ</i> and sacred courtesans. Some half-dozen
      towns or fortified villages, such as Bitzîti,** the Lesser Sidon, and
      Sarepta, were scattered along the shore, or on the lowest slopes of the
      Lebanon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Astartê is represented in the Bible as the goddess of the
     Sidonians, and she is in fact the object of the invocations
     addressed to the mistress Deity in the Sidonian
     inscriptions, the patroness of the town. Kings and queens
     were her priests and priestesses respectively.

     ** Bitzîti is not mentioned except in the Assyrian texts,
     and has been identified with the modern region Ait ez-Zeîtûn
     to the south-east of Sidon. It is very probably the Elaia of
     Philo of Byblos, the Biais of Dionysios Periegetes, which
     Renan is inclined to identify with Heldua, Khan-Khaldi, by
     substituting Eldis as a correction.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sidonian territory reached its limit at the Cape of Sarepta, where the
      high-lands again meet the sea at the boundary of one of those basins into
      which Phoenicia is divided. Passing beyond this cape, we come first upon a
      Tyrian outpost, the Town of Birds;* then upon the village of Nazana** with
      its river of the same name; beyond this upon a plain hemmed in by low
      hills, cultivated to their summits; then on tombs and gardens in the
      suburbs of Autu;*** and, further still, to a fleet of boats moored at a
      short distance from the shore, where a group of reefs and islands
      furnishes at one and the same time a site for the houses and temples of
      Tyre, and a protection from its foes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Phoenician name of Ornithônpolis is unknown to us: the
     town is often mentioned by the geographers of classic times,
     but with certain differences, some placing it to the north
     and others to the south of Sarepta. It was near to the site
     of Adlun, the Adnonum of the Latin itineraries, if it was
     not actually the same place.

     ** Nazana was both the name of the place and the river, as
     Kasimîyeh and Khan Kasimîyeh, near the same locality, are
     to-day.

     *** Autu was identified by Brugsch with Avatha, which is
     probably El-Awwâtîn, on the hill facing Tyre. Max Müller,
     who reads the word as Authu, Ozu, prefers the Uru or Ushu of
     the Assyrian texts.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was already an ancient town at the beginning of the Egyptian conquest.
      As in other places of ancient date, the inhabitants rejoiced in stories of
      the origin of things in which the city figured as the most venerable in
      the world. After the period of the creating gods, there followed
      immediately, according to the current legends, two or three generations of
      minor deities&mdash;heroes of light and flame&mdash;who had learned how to
      subdue fire and turn it to their needs; then a race of giants, associated
      with the giant peaks of Kasios, Lebanon, Hermon, and Brathy;* after which
      were born two male children&mdash;twins: Samem-rum, the lord of the
      supernal heaven, and Usôos, the hunter. Human beings at this time lived a
      savage life, wandering through the woods, and given up to shameful vices.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The identification of the peak of Brathy is uncertain. The
     name has been associated with Tabor: since it exactly
     recalls the name of the cypress and of Berytus, it would be
     more prudent, perhaps, to look for the name in that of one
     of the peaks of the Lebanon near the latter town.
</pre>
    <p>
      Samemrum took up his abode among them in that region which became in later
      times the Tyrian coast, and showed them how to build huts, papyrus, or
      other reeds: Usôos in the mean time pursued the avocation of a hunter of
      wild beasts, living upon their flesh and clothing himself with their
      skins. A conflict at length broke out between the two brothers, the
      inevitable result of rivalry between the ever-wandering hunter and the
      husbandman attached to the soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usôos succeeded in holding his own till the day when fire and wind took
      the part of his enemy against him.* The trees, shaken and made to rub
      against each other by the tempest, broke into flame from the friction, and
      the forest was set on fire. Usôos, seizing a leafy branch, despoiled it of
      its foliage, and placing it in the water let it drift out to sea, bearing
      him, the first of his race, with it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The text simply states the material facts, the tempest and
     the fire: the general movement of the narrative seems to
     prove that the intervention of these elements is an episode
     in the quarrel between the two brothers&mdash;that in which
     Usôos is forced to fly from the region civilized by
     Samemrum.
</pre>
    <p>
      Landing on one of the islands, he set up two menhirs, dedicating them to
      fire and wind that he might thenceforward gain their favour. He poured out
      at their base the blood of animals he had slaughtered, and after his
      death, his companions continued to perform the rites which he had
      inaugurated.

      The town which he had begun to build on the sea-girt isle was called Tyre,
      the &ldquo;Rock,&rdquo; and the two rough stones which he had set up remained for a
      long time as a sort of talisman, bringing good luck to its inhabitants. It
      was asserted of old that the island had not always been fixed, but that it
      rose and fell, with the waves like a raft. Two peaks looked down upon it&mdash;the
      &ldquo;Ambrosian Rocks&rdquo;&mdash;between which grew the olive tree of Astartê,
      sheltered by a curtain of flame from external danger. An eagle perched
      thereon watched over a viper coiled round the trunk: the whole island
      would cease to float as soon as a mortal should succeed in sacrificing the
      bird in honour of the gods. Usôos, the Herakles, destroyer of monsters,
      taught the people of the coast how to build boats, and how to manage them;
      he then made for the island and disembarked: the bird offered himself
      spontaneously to his knife, and as soon as its blood had moistened the
      earth, Tyre rooted itself fixedly opposite the mainland. Coins of the
      Roman period represent the chief elements in this legend; sometimes the
      eagle and olive tree, sometimes the olive tree and the stelo, and
      sometimes the two stelæ only. From this time forward the gods never ceased
      to reside on the holy island; Astartê herself was born there, and one of
      the temples there showed to the admiration of the faithful a fallen star&mdash;an
      aerolite which she had brought back from one of her journeys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baal was called the Melkarth. king of the city, and the Greeks after»
      wards identified him with their Herakles. His worship was of a severe and
      exacting character: a fire burned perpetually in his sanctuary; his
      priests, like those of the Egyptians, had their heads shaved; they wore
      garments of spotless white linen, held pork in abomination, and refused
      permission to married women to approach the altars.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The worship of Melkarth at Gados (Cadiz) and the functions
     of his priests are described by Silius Italicus: as Gades
     was a Tyrian colony, it has been naturally assumed that the
     main features of the religion of Tyre were reproduced there,
     and Silius&rsquo;s account of the Melkarth of Gades thus applies
     to his namesake of the mother city.

      Festivals, similar to those of Adonis at Byblos, were held in his honour
      twice a year: in the summer, when the sun burnt up the earth with his
      glowing heat, he offered himself as an expiatory victim to the solar orb,
      giving himself to the flames in order to obtain some mitigation of the
      severity of the sky;* once the winter had brought with it a refreshing
      coolness, he came back to life again, and his return was celebrated with
      great joy. His temple stood in a prominent place on the largest of the
      islands furthest away from the mainland. It served to remind the people of
      the remoteness of their origin, for the priests relegated its foundation
      almost to the period of the arrival of the Phoenicians on the shores of
      the Mediterranean. The town had no supply of fresh water, and there was no
      submarine spring like that of Arvad to provide a resource in time of
      necessity; the inhabitants had, therefore, to resort to springs which were
      fortunately to be found everywhere on the hillsides of the mainland. The
      waters of the well of Eas el-Aîn had been led down to the shore and dammed
      up there, so that boats could procure a ready supply from this source in
      time of peace: in time of war the inhabitants of Tyre had to trust to the
      cisterns in which they had collected the rains that fell at certain
      seasons.**

     ** Abisharri (Abimilki), King of Tyre, confesses to the
     Pharaoh Amenôthes III. that in case of a siege his town
     would neither have water nor wood. Aqueducts and conduits of
     water are spoken of by Menander as existing in the time of
     Shalmaneser; all modern historians agree in attributing
     their construction to a very remote antiquity.

      The strait separating the island from the mainland was some six or seven
      hundred yards in breadth,* less than that of the Nile at several points of
      its course through Middle Egypt, but it was as effective as a broader
      channel to stop the movement of an army: a fleet alone would have a chance
      of taking the city by surprise, or of capturing it after a lengthened
      siege.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * According to the writers who were contemporary with
     Alexander, the strait was 4 stadia wide (nearly 1/2 mile),
     or 500 paces (about 3/8 mile), at the period when the
     Macedonians undertook the siege of the town; the author
     followed by Pliny says 700 paces, possibly over&mdash;mile wide.
     From the observations of Poulain de Bossay, Renan thinks the
     space between the island and the mainland might be nearly a
     mile in width, but we should perhaps do well to reduce this
     higher figure and adopt one agreeing better with the
     statements of Diodorus and Quintus Curtius.
</pre>

      Like the coast region opposite Arvad, the shore which faced Tyre, lying
      between the mouth of the Litany and ras el-Aîn, was an actual suburb of
      the city itself&mdash;with its gardens, its cultivated fields, its
      cemeteries, its villas, and its fortifications. Here the inhabitants of
      the island were accustomed to bury their dead, and hither they repaired
      for refreshment during the heat of the summer. To the north the little
      town of Mahalliba, on the southern bank of the Litâny, and almost hidden
      from view by a turn in the hills, commanded the approaches to the Bekaa,
      and the high-road to Coele-Syria.* To the south, at Ras el-Aîn, Old Tyre
      (Palastyrus) looked down upon the route leading into Galilee by way of the
      mountains.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Mahalliba is the present Khurbet-Mahallib.

     ** Palrotyrus has often been considered as a Tyre on the
     mainland of greater antiquity than the town of the same name
     on the island; it is now generally admitted that it was
     merely an outpost, which is conjecturally placed by most
     scholars in the neighbourhood of Ras el-Aîn.

      Eastwards Autu commanded the landing-places on the shore, and served to
      protect the reservoirs; it lay under the shadow of a rock, on which was
      built, facing the insular temple of Melkarth, protector of mariners, a
      sanctuary of almost equal antiquity dedicated to his namesake of the
      mainland.* The latter divinity was probably the representative of the
      legendary Samemrum, who had built his village on the coast, while Usôos
      had founded his on the ocean. He was the Baalsamîm of starry tunic, lord
      of heaven and king of the sun.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * If the name has been preserved, as I believe it to be, in
     that of El-Awwâtîn, the town must be that whose ruins we
     find at the foot of Tell-Mashûk, and which are often
     mistaken for those of Palastyrus. The temple on the summit
     of the Tell was probably that of Heracles Astrochitôn
     mentioned by Nonnus.
</pre>
    <p>
      As was customary, a popular Astartê was associated with these deities of
      high degree, and tradition asserted that Melkarth purchased her favour by
      the gift of the first robe of Tyrian purple which was ever dyed.
      Priestesses of the goddess had dwellings in all parts of the plain, and in
      several places the caves are still pointed out where they entertained the
      devotees of the goddess. Behind Autu the ground rises abruptly, and along
      the face of the escarpment, half hidden by trees and brushwood, are the
      remains of the most important of the Tyrian burying-places, consisting of
      half-filled-up pits, isolated caves, and dark galleries, where whole
      families lie together in their last sleep. In some spots the chalky mass
      has been literally honeycombed by the quarrying gravedigger, and regular
      lines of chambers follow one another in the direction of the strata, after
      the fashion of the rock-cut tombs of Upper Egypt. They present a bare and
      dismal appearance both within and without. The entrances are narrow and
      arched, the ceilings low, the walls bare and colourless, unrelieved by
      moulding, picture, or inscription. At one place only, near the modern
      village of Hanaweh, a few groups of figures and coarsely cut stelae are to
      be found, indicating, it would seem, the burying-place of some chief of
      very early times.

      These figures run in parallel lines along the rocky sides of a wild
      ravine. They vary from 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet in height, the bodies
      being represented by rectangular pilasters, sometimes merely rough-hewn,
      at others grooved with curved lines to suggest the folds of the Asiatic
      garments; the head is carved full face, though the eyes are given in
      profile, and the summary treatment of the modelling gives evidence of a
      certain skill. Whether they are to be regarded as the product of a
      primitive Amorite art or of a school of Phoenician craftsmen, we are
      unable to determine. In the time of their prosperity the Tyrians certainly
      pushed their frontier as far as this region. The wind-swept but fertile
      country lying among the ramifications of the lowest spurs of the Lebanon
      bears to this day innumerable traces of their indefatigable industry&mdash;remains
      of dwellings, conduits and watercourses, cisterns, pits, millstones and
      vintage-troughs, are scattered over the fields, interspersed with oil and
      wine presses. The Phoenicians took naturally to agriculture, and carried
      it to such a high state of perfection as to make it an actual science, to
      which the neighbouring peoples of the Mediterranean were glad to
      accommodate their modes of culture in later times.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Their taste for agriculture, and the comparative
     perfection of their modes of culture, are proved by the
     greatness of the remains still to be observed: &ldquo;The
     Phoenicians constructed a winepress, a trough, to last for
     ever.&rdquo; Their colonists at Carthage carried with them the same
     clever methods, and the Romans borrowed many excellent
     things in the way of agriculture from Carthaginian books,
     especially from those of Mago.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among no other people was the art of irrigation so successfully practised,
      and from such a narrow strip of territory as belonged to them no other
      cultivators could have gathered such abundant harvests of wheat and
      barley, and such supplies of grapes, olives, and other fruits. From Arvad
      to Tyre, and even beyond it, the littoral region and the central parts of
      the valleys presented a long ribbon of verdure of varying breadth, where
      fields of corn were blended with gardens and orchards and shady woods. The
      whole region was independent and self-supporting, the inhabitants having
      no need to address themselves to their neighbours in the interior, or to
      send their children to seek their fortune in distant lands. To insure
      prosperity, nothing was needed but a slight exercise of labour and freedom
      from the devastating influence of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of the country was such as to secure it from attack, and from
      the conflicts which laid waste the rest of Syria. Along almost the entire
      eastern border of the country the Lebanon was a great wall of defence
      running parallel to the coast, strengthened at each extremity by the
      additional protection of the rivers Nahr el-Kebîr and Litany. Its slopes
      were further defended by the forest, which, with its lofty trees and
      brushwood, added yet another barrier to that afforded by rocks and snow.
      Hunters&rsquo; or shepherds&rsquo; paths led here and there in tortuous courses from
      one side of the mountain to the other. Near the middle of the country two
      roads, practicable in all seasons, secured communications between the
      littoral and the plain of the interior. They branched off on either side
      from the central road in the neighbourhood of Tabakhi, south of Qodshu,
      and served the needs of the wooded province of Magara.* This region was
      inhabited by pillaging tribes, which the Egyptians called at one time
      Lamnana, the Libanites,** at others Shausu, using for them the same
      appellation as that which they bestowed upon the Bedouin of the desert.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Magara is mentioned in the <i>Anastasi Papyrus</i>, No. 1, and
     Chabas has identified it with the plain of Macra, which
     Strabo places in Syria, in the neighbourhood of Eloutheros.

     ** The name Lamnana is given in a picture of the campaigns
     of Seti I.
</pre>
    <p>
      The roads through this province ran under the dense shade afforded by
      oaks, cedars, and cypresses, in an obscurity favourable to the habits of
      the wolves and hyamas which infested it, and even of those thick-maned
      lions known to Asia at the time; and then proceeding in its course,
      crossed the ridge in the neighbourhood of the snow-peak called Shaua,
      which is probably the Sannîn of our times. While one of these roads,
      running north along the lake of Yamuneh and through the gorge of Akura,
      then proceeded along the Adonis* to Byblos, the other took a southern
      direction, and followed the Nahr el-Kelb to the sea.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This is the road pointed out by Renan as the easiest but
     least known of those which cross the Lebanon; the remains of
     an Assyrian inscription graven on the rocks near Aîn el-
     Asafîr show that it was employed from a very early date, and
     Renan thought that it was used by the armies which came from
     the upper valley of the Orontes.
</pre>
    <p>
      Towards the mouth of the latter a wall of rock opposes the progress of the
      river, and leaves at length but a narrow and precipitous defile for the
      passage of its waters: a pathway cut into the cliff at a very remote date
      leads almost perpendicularly from the bottom of the precipice to the
      summit of the promontory. Commerce followed these short and direct routes,
      but invading hosts very rarely took advantage of them, although they
      offered access into the very heart of Phoenicia. Invaders would encounter
      here, in fact, a little known and broken country, lending itself readily
      to surprises and ambuscades; and should they reach the foot of the Lebanon
      range, they would find themselves entrapped in a region of slippery
      defiles, with steep paths at intervals cut into the rock, and almost
      inaccessible to chariots or horses, and so narrow in places that a handful
      of resolute men could have held them for a long time against whole
      battalions. The enemy preferred to make for the two natural breaches at
      the respective extremities of the line of defence, and for the two insular
      cities which flanked the approaches to them&mdash;Tyre in the case of
      those coming from Egypt, Arvad and Simyra for assailants from the
      Euphrates. The Arvadians, bellicose by nature, would offer strong
      resistance to the invader, and not permit themselves to be conquered
      without a brave struggle with the enemy, however powerful he might be.*
      When the disproportion of the forces which they could muster against the
      enemy convinced them of the folly of attempting an open conflict, their
      island-home offered them a refuge where they would be safe from any
      attacks.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Thûtmosis III. was obliged to enter on a campaign against
     Arvad in the year XXIX., in the year XXX., and probably
     twice in the following years. Under Amenôthes III. and IV.
     we see that these people took part in all the intrigues
     directed against Egypt; they were the allies of the Khati
     against Ramses II. in the campaign of the year V. and later
     on we find them involved in most of the wars against
     Assyria.

      Sometimes the burning and pillaging of their property on the mainland
      might reduce them to throw themselves on the mercy of their foes, but such
      submission did not last long, and they welcomed the slightest occasion for
      regaining their liberty. Conquered again and again on account of the
      smallness of their numbers, they were never discouraged by their reverses,
      and Phoenicia owed all its military history for a long period to their
      prowess. The Tyrians were of a more accommodating nature, and there is no
      evidence, at least during the early centuries of their existence, of the
      display of those obstinate and blind transports of bravery by which the
      Arvadians were carried away.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * No campaign against Tyre is mentioned in any of the
     Egyptian annals: the expedition of Thûtmosis III. against
     Senzauru was directed against a town of Coele-Syria
     mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna tablets with the orthography
     Zinzar, the Sizara-Larissa of Græco-Roman times, the Shaizar
     of the Arab Chronicles. On the contrary, the Tel el-Amarna
     tablets contain several passages which manifest the fidelity
     of Tyre and its governors to the King of Egypt.

      Their foreign policy was reduced to a simple arithmetical question, which
      they discussed in the light of their industrial or commercial interests.
      As soon as they had learned from a short experience that a certain Pharaoh
      had at his disposal armies against which they could offer no serious
      opposition, they at once surrendered to him, and thought only of obtaining
      the greatest profit from the vassalage to which they were condemned. The
      obligation to pay tribute did not appear to them so much in the light of a
      burthen or a sacrifice, as a means of purchasing the right to go to and
      fro freely in Egypt, or in the countries subject to its influence. The
      commerce acquired by these privileges recouped them more than a
      hundredfold for all that their overlord demanded from them. The other
      cities of the coast&mdash;Sidon, Berytus, Byblos&mdash;usually followed
      the example of Tyre, whether from mercenary motives, or from their
      naturally pacific disposition, or from a sense of their impotence; and the
      same intelligent resignation with which, as we know, they accepted the
      supremacy of the great Egyptian empire, was doubtless displayed in earlier
      centuries in their submission to the Babylonians. Their records show that
      they did not accept this state of things merely through cowardice or
      indolence, for they are represented as ready to rebel and shake off the
      yoke of their foreign master when they found it incompatible with their
      practical interests. But their resort to war was exceptional; they
      generally preferred to submit to the powers that be, and to accept from
      them as if on lease the strip of coast-line at the base of the Lebanon,
      which served as a site for their warehouses and dockyards. Thus they did
      not find the yoke of the stranger irksome&mdash;the sea opening up to them
      a realm of freedom and independence which compensated them for the
      limitations of both territory and liberty imposed upon them at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The epoch which was marked by their first venture on the Mediterranean,
      and the motives which led to it, were alike unknown to them. The gods had
      taught them navigation, and from the beginning of things they had taken to
      the sea as fishermen, or as explorers in search of new lands.* They were
      not driven by poverty to leave their continental abode, or inspired
      thereby with a zeal for distant cruises. They had at home sufficient corn
      and wine, oil and fruits, to meet all their needs, and even to administer
      to a life of luxury. And if they lacked cattle, the abundance of fish
      within their reach compensated for the absence of flesh-meat.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * According to one of the cosmogonies of Sanchoniathon,
     Khusôr, who has been identified with Hephsestos, was the
     inventor of the fishing-boat, and was the first among men
     and gods who taught navigation. According to another legend,
     Melkarth showed the Tyrians how to make a raft from the
     branches of a fig tree, while the construction of the first
     ships is elsewhere ascribed to the <i>Cabiri</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nor was it the number of commodiously situated ports on their coast which
      induced them to become a seafaring people, for their harbours were badly
      protected for the most part, and offered no shelter when the wind set in
      from the north, the rugged shore presenting little resource against the
      wind and waves in its narrow and shallow havens. It was the nature of the
      country itself which contributed more than anything else to make them
      mariners. The precipitous mountain masses which separate one valley from
      another rendered communication between them difficult, while they served
      also as lurking-places for robbers. Commerce endeavoured to follow,
      therefore, the sea-route in preference to the devious ways of this
      highwayman&rsquo;s region, and it accomplished its purpose the more readily
      because the common occupation of sea-fishing had familiarised the people
      with every nook and corner on the coast. The continual wash of the surge
      had worn away the bases of the limestone cliffs, and the superincumbent
      masses tumbling down into the sea formed lines of rocks, hardly rising
      above the water-level, which fringed the headlands with perilous reefs,
      against which the waves broke continuously at the slightest wind. It
      required some bravery to approach them, and no little skill to steer one
      of the frail boats, which these people were accustomed to employ from the
      earliest times, scatheless amid the breakers. The coasting trade was
      attracted from Arvad successively to Berytus, Sidon, and Tyre, and finally
      to the other towns of the coast. It was in full operation, doubtless, from
      the VIth Egyptian dynasty onwards, when the Pharaohs no longer hesitated
      to embark troops at the mouth of the Nile for speedy transmission to the
      provinces of Southern Syria, and it was by this coasting route that the
      tin and amber of the north succeeded in reaching the interior of Egypt.
      The trade was originally, it would seem, in the hands of those mysterious
      Kefâtiu of whom the name only was known in later times. When the
      Phoenicians established themselves at the foot of the Lebanon, they had
      probably only to take the place of their predecessors and to follow the
      beaten tracks which they had already made. We have every reason to believe
      that they took to a seafaring life soon after their arrival in the
      country, and that they adapted themselves and their civilization readily
      to the exigencies of a maritime career.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Connexion between Phoenicia and Greece was fully
     established at the outbreak of the Egyptian wars, and we may
     safely assume their existence in the centuries immediately
     preceding the second millennium before our era.
</pre>
    <p>
      In their towns, as in most sea-ports, there was a considerable foreign
      element, both of slaves and freemen, but the Egyptians confounded them all
      under one name, Kefâtiu, whether they were Cypriotes, Asiatics, or
      Europeans, or belonged to the true Tyrian and Sidonian race. The costume
      of the Kafîti was similar to that worn by the people of the interior&mdash;the
      loin-cloth, with or without a long upper garment: while in tiring the hair
      they adopted certain refinements, specially a series of curls which the
      men arranged in the form of an aigrette above their foreheads. This motley
      collection of races was ruled over by an oligarchy of merchants and
      shipowners, whose functions were hereditary, and who usually paid homage
      to a single king, the representative of the tutelary god, and absolute
      master of the city.*

      The industries pursued in Phoenicia were somewhat similar to those of

      All manufactures bore the impress of Babylonian influence, and their
      implements, weights, measures, and system of exchange were the same as
      those in use among the Chaldæans. The products of the country were,
      however, not sufficient to freight the fleets which sailed from Phoenicia
      every year bound for all parts of the known world, and additional supplies
      had to be regularly obtained from neighbouring peoples, who thus became
      used to pour into Tyre and Sidon the surplus of their manufactures, or of
      the natural wealth of their country. The Phoenicians were also accustomed
      to send caravans into regions which they could not reach in their caracks,
      and to establish trading stations at the fords of rivers, or in the passes
      over mountain ranges. We know of the existence of such emporia at Laish
      near the sources of the Jordan, at Thapsacus, and at Nisibis, and they
      must have served the purpose of a series of posts on the great highways of
      the world. The settlements of the Phoenicians always assumed the character
      of colonies, and however remote they might be from their fatherland, the
      colonists never lost the manners and customs of their native country. They
      collected together into their <i>okels</i> or storehouses such wares and
      commodities as they could purchase in their new localities, and,
      transmitting them periodically to the coast, shipped them thence to all
      parts of the world.

      Not only were they acquainted with every part of the Mediterranean, but
      they had even made voyages beyond its limits. In the absence, however, of
      any specific records of their naval enterprise, the routes they followed
      must be a subject of conjecture. They were accustomed to relate that the
      gods, after having instructed them in the art of navigation, had shown
      them the way to the setting sun, and had led them by their example to make
      voyages even beyond the mouths of the ocean. El of Byblos was the first to
      leave Syria; he conquered Greece and Egypt, Sicily and Libya, civilizing
      their inhabitants, and laying the foundation of cities everywhere. The
      Sidonian Astartê, with her head surmounted by the horns of an ox, was the
      next to begin her wanderings over the inhabited earth. Melkarth completed
      the task of the gods by discovering and subjugating those countries which
      had escaped the notice of his predecessors. Hundreds of local traditions,
      to be found on all the shores of the Mediterranean down to Roman times,
      bore witness to the pervasive influence of the old Canaanite colonisation.
      At Cyprus, for instance, wo find traces of the cultus of Kinyras, King of
      Byblos and father of Adonis; again, at Crete, it is the daughter of a
      Prince of Sidon, Buropa, who is carried off by Zeus under the form of a
      bull; it was Kadmos, sent forth to seek Buropa, who visited Cyprus,
      Rhodes, and the Cyclades before building Thebes in Boeotia and dying in
      the forests of Illyria. In short, wherever the Phoenicians had obtained a
      footing, their audacious activity made such an indelible impression upon
      the mind of the native inhabitants that they never forgot those vigorous
      thick-set men with pale faces and dark beards, and soft and specious
      speech, who appeared at intervals in their large and swift sailing
      vessels. They made their way cautiously along the coast, usually keeping
      in sight of land, making sail when the wind was favourable, or taking to
      the oars for days together when occasion demanded it, anchoring at night
      under the shelter of some headland, or in bad weather hauling their
      vessels up the beach until the morrow. They did not shrink when it was
      necessary from trusting themselves to the open sea, directing their course
      by the Pole-star;* in this manner they often traversed long distances out
      of sight of land, and they succeeded in making in a short time voyages
      previously deemed long and costly.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Greeks for this reason called it Phonikê, the
     Phoenician star; ancient writers refer to the use which the
     Phoenicians made of the Pole-star to guide them in
     navigation.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is hard to say whether they were as much merchants as pirates&mdash;indeed,
      they hardly knew themselves&mdash;and their peaceful or warlike attitude
      towards vessels which they encountered on the seas, or towards the people
      whose countries they frequented, was probably determined by the
      circumstances of the moment.* If on arrival at a port they felt themselves
      no match for the natives, the instinct of the merchant prevailed, and that
      of the pirate was kept in the background. They landed peaceably, gained
      the good will of the native chief and his nobles by small presents, and
      spreading out their wares, contented themselves, if they could do no
      better, with the usual advantage obtained in an exchange of goods.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The manner in which the Phoenicians plied their trade is
     strikingly described in the <i>Odyssey</i>, in the part where
     Eumaios relates how he was carried off by a Sidonian vessel
     and sold as a slave: cf. the passage which mentions the
     ravages of the Greeks on the coast of the Delta. Herodotus
     recalls the rape of Io, daughter of Inachos, by the
     Phoenicians, who carried her and her companions into Egypt;
     on the other hand, during one of their Egyptian expeditions
     they had taken two priestesses from Thebes, and had
     transported one of them to Dodona, the other into Libya.
</pre>
    <p>
      They were never in a hurry, and would remain in one spot until they had
      exhausted all the resources of the country, while they knew to a nicety
      how to display their goods attractively before the expected customer.
      Their wares comprised weapons and ornaments for men, axes, swords, incised
      or damascened daggers with hilts of gold or ivory, bracelets, necklaces,
      amulets of all kinds, enamelled vases, glass-work, stuffs dyed purple or
      embroidered with gay colours. At times the natives, whose cupidity was
      excited by the exhibition of such valuables, would attempt to gain
      possession of them either by craft or by violence. They would kill the men
      who had landed, or attempt to surprise the vessel during the night. But
      more often it was the Phoenicians who took advantage of the friendliness
      or the weakness of their hosts.

      They would turn treacherously upon the unarmed crowd when absorbed in the
      interest of buying and selling; robbing and killing the old men, they
      would make prisoners of the young and strong, the women and children,
      carrying them off to sell them in those markets where slaves were known to
      fetch the highest price. This was a recognised trade, but it exposed the
      Phoenicians to the danger of reprisals, and made them objects of an
      undying hatred. When on these distant expeditions they were subject to
      trivial disasters which might lead to serious consequences. A mast might
      break, an oar might damage a portion of the bulwarks, a storm might force
      them to throw overboard part of their cargo or their provisions; in such
      predicaments they had no means of repairing the damage, and, unable to
      obtain help in any of the places they might visit, their prospects were of
      a desperate character. They soon, therefore, learned the necessity of
      establishing cities of refuge at various points in the countries with
      which they traded&mdash;stations where they could go to refit and
      revictual their vessels, to fill up the complement of their crews, to take
      in new freight, and, if necessary, pass the winter or wait for fair
      weather before continuing their voyage. For this purpose they chose by
      preference islands lying within easy distance of the mainland, like their
      native cities of Tyre and Arvad, but possessing a good harbour or
      roadstead. If an island were not available, they selected a peninsula with
      a narrow isthmus, or a rock standing at the extremity of a promontory,
      which a handful of men could defend against any attack, and which could be
      seen from a considerable distance by their pilots. Most of their stations
      thus happily situated became at length important towns. They were
      frequented by the natives from the interior, who allied themselves with
      the new-comers, and furnished them not only with objects of trade, but
      with soldiers, sailors, and recruits for their army; and such was the
      rapid spread of these colonies, that before long the Mediterranean was
      surrounded by an almost unbroken chain of Phoenician strongholds and
      trading stations.

      All the towns of the mother country&mdash;Arvad, Byblos, Berytus, Tyre,
      and Sidon&mdash;possessed vessels engaged in cruising long before the
      Egyptian conquest of Syria. We have no direct information from any
      existing monument to show us what these vessels were like, but we are
      familiar with the construction of the galleys which formed the fleets of
      the Pharaohs of the XVIIIth dynasty. The art of shipbuilding had made
      considerable progress since the times of the Memphite kings. Prom the
      period when Egypt aspired to become one of the great powers of the world,
      she doubtless endeavoured to bring her naval force to the same pitch of
      perfection as her land forces could boast of, and her fleets probably
      consisted of the best vessels which the dockyards of that day could turn
      out. Phoenician vessels of this period may therefore be regarded with
      reason as constructed on lines similar to those of the Egyptian ships,
      differing from them merely in the minor details of the shape of the hull
      and manner of rigging. The hull continued to be built long and narrow,
      rising at the stem and stern. The bow was terminated by a sort of hook, to
      which, in time of peace, a bronze ornament was attached, fashioned to
      represent the head of a divinity, gazelle, or bull, while in time of war
      this was superseded by a metal cut-water made fast to the hull by several
      turns of stout rope, the blade rising some couple of yards above the level
      of the deck.* The poop was ornamented with a projection firmly attached to
      the body of the vessel, but curved inwards and terminated by an open
      lotus-flower. An upper deck, surrounded by a wooden rail, was placed at
      the bow and stern to serve as forecastle and quarterdecks respectively,
      and in order to protect the vessel from the danger of heavy seas the ship
      was strengthened by a structure to which we find nothing analogous in the
      shipbuilding of classical times: an enormous cable attached to the
      gammonings of the bow rose obliquely to a height of about a couple of
      yards above the deck, and, passing over four small crutched masts, was
      made fast again to the gammonings of the stern. The hull measured from the
      blade of the cut-water to the stern-post some twenty to five and twenty
      yards, but the lowest part of the hold did not exceed five feet in depth.
      There was no cabin, and the ballast, arms, provisions, and spare-rigging
      occupied the open hold.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To get a clear idea of the details of this structure, we
     have only to compare the appearance of ships with and
     without a cut-water in the scenes at Thebes, representing
     the celebration of a festival at the return of the fleet.

     ** M. Glaser thinks that there were cabins for the crew
     under the deck, and he recognises in the sixteen oblong
     marks on the sides of the vessels at Deîr el-Bahari so many
     dead-lights; as there could not have been space for so many
     cabins, I had concluded that these were ports for oars to be
     used in time of battle, but on further consideration I saw
     that they represented the ends of the beams supporting the
     deck.
</pre>
    <p>
      The bulwarks were raised to a height of some two feet, and the thwarts of
      the rowers ran up to them on both the port and starboard sides, leaving an
      open space in the centre for the long-boat, bales of merchandise,
      soldiers, slaves, and additional passengers.* A double set of
      steering-oars and a single mast completed the equipment. The latter, which
      rose to a height of some twenty-six feet, was placed amidships, and was
      held in an upright position by stays. The masthead was surmounted by two
      arrangements which answered respectively to the top [&ldquo;gabie&rdquo;] and <i>calcet</i>
      of the masts of a galley.** There were no shrouds on each side from the
      masthead to the rail, but, in place of them, two stays ran respectively to
      the bow and stern. The single square-sail was extended between two yards
      some sixty to seventy feet long, and each made of two pieces spliced
      together at the centre. The upper yard was straight, while the lower
      curved upward at the ends. The yard was hoisted and lowered by two
      halyards, which were made fast aft at the feet of the steersmen. The yard
      was kept in its place by two lifts which came down from the masthead, and
      were attached respectively about eight feet from the end of each yard-arm.
      When the yard was hauled up it was further supported by six auxiliary
      lifts, three being attached to each yard-arm. The lower yard, made fast to
      the mast by a figure-of-eight knot, was secured by sixteen lifts, which,
      like those of the upper yard, worked through the &ldquo;calcet.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * One of the bas-reliefs exhibits a long-boat in the water
     at the time the fleet was at anchor at Puanît. As we do not
     find any vessel towing one after her, we naturally conclude
     that the boat must have been stowed on board.

     ** The &ldquo;gabie&rdquo; was a species of top where a sailor was placed
     on the look-out. The &ldquo;calcet&rdquo; is, properly speaking, a
     square block of wood containing the sheaves on which the
     halyards travelled. The Egyptian apparatus had no sheaves,
     and answers to the &ldquo;calcet&rdquo; on the masts of a galley only in
     its serving the same purpose.
</pre>
    <p>
      The crew comprised thirty rowers, fifteen on each side, four top-men, two
      steersmen, a pilot at the bow, who signalled to the men at the helm the
      course to steer, a captain and a governor of the slaves, who formed,
      together with ten soldiers, a total of some fifty men.* In time of battle,
      as the rowers would be exposed to the missiles of the enemy, the bulwarks
      were further heightened by a mantlet, behind which the oars could be
      freely moved, while the bodies of the men were fully protected, their
      heads alone being visible above it. The soldiers were stationed as
      follows: two of them took their places on the forecastle, a third was
      perched on the masthead in a sort of cage improvised on the bars forming
      the top, while the remainder were posted on the deck and poop, from which
      positions and while waiting for the order to board they could pour a
      continuous volley of arrows on the archers and sailors of the enemy.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have made this calculation from an examination of the
     scenes in which ships are alternatively represented as at
     anchor and under weigh. I know of vessels of smaller size,
     and consequently with a smaller crew, but I know of none
     larger or more fully manned.

     ** The details are taken from the only representation of a
     naval battle which we possess up to this moment, viz. that
     of which I shall have occasion to speak further on in
     connection with the reign of Ramses III.
</pre>
    <p>
      The first colony of which the Phoenicians made themselves masters was that
      island of Cyprus whose low, lurid outline they could see on fine summer
      evenings in the glow of the western sky. Some hundred and ten miles in
      length and thirty-six in breadth, it is driven like a wedge into the angle
      which Asia Minor makes with the Syrian coast: it throws out to the
      north-east a narrow strip of land, somewhat like an extended finger
      pointing to where the two coasts meet at the extremity of the gulf of
      Issos. A limestone cliff, of almost uniform height throughout, bounds, for
      half its length at least, the northern side of the island, broken
      occasionally by short deep valleys, which open out into creeks deeply
      embayed. A scattered population of fishermen exercised their calling in
      this region, and small towns, of which we possess only the Greek or
      Grecised names&mdash;Karpasia, Aphrodision, Kerynia, Lapethos&mdash;led
      there a slumbering existence. Almost in the centre of the island two
      volcanic peaks, Troodes and Olympos, face each other, and rise to a height
      of nearly 7000 feet, the range of mountains to which they belong&mdash;that
      of Aous&mdash;forming the framework of the island. The spurs of this range
      fall by a gentle gradient towards the south, and spread out either into
      stony slopes favourable to the culture of the vine, or into great maritime
      flats fringed with brackish lagoons. The valley which lies on the northern
      side of this chain runs from sea to sea in an almost unbroken level. A
      scarcely perceptible watershed divides the valley into two basins similar
      to those of Syria, the larger of the two lying opposite to the Phoenician
      coast. The soil consists of black mould, as rich as that of Egypt, and
      renewed yearly by the overflowing of the Pediæos and its affluents. Thick
      forests occupied the interior, promising inexhaustible resources to any
      naval power. Even under the Koman emperors the Cypriotes boasted that they
      could build and fit out a ship from the keel to the masthead without
      looking to resources beyond those of their own island. The ash, pine,
      cypress, and oak flourished on the sides of the range of Aous, while
      cedars grew there to a greater height and girth than even on the Lebanon.
      Wheat, barley, olive trees, vines, sweet-smelling woods for burning on the
      altar, medicinal plants such as the poppy and the <i>ladanum</i>, henna
      for staining with a deep orange colour the lips, eyelids, palm, nails, and
      fingertips of the women, all found here a congenial habitat; while a
      profusion everywhere of sweet-smelling flowers, which saturated the air
      with their penetrating odours&mdash;spring violets, many-coloured
      anemones, the lily, hyacinth, crocus, narcissus, and wild rose&mdash;led
      the Greeks to bestow upon the island the designation of &ldquo;the balmy
      Cyprus.&rdquo; Mines also contributed their share to the riches of which the
      island could boast. Iron in small quantities, alum, asbestos, agate and
      other precious stones, are still to be found there, and in ancient times
      the neighbourhood of Tamassos yielded copper in such quantities that the
      Romans were accustomed to designate this metal by the name &ldquo;Cyprium,&rdquo; and
      the word passed from them into all the languages of Europe. It is not easy
      to determine the race to which the first inhabitants of the island
      belonged, if we are not to see in them a branch of the Kefâtiu, who
      frequented the Asiatic shores of the Mediterranean from a very remote
      period. In the time of Egyptian supremacy they called their country Asi,
      and this name inclines one to connect the people with the Ægeans.* An
      examination of the objects found in the most ancient tombs of the island
      seems to confirm this opinion. These consist, for the most part, of
      weapons and implements of stone&mdash;knives, hatchets, hammers, and
      arrow-heads; and mingled with these rude objects a score of different
      kinds of pottery, chiefly hand-made and of coarse design&mdash;pitchers
      with contorted bowls, shallow buckets, especially of the milk-pail
      variety, provided with spouts and with pairs of rudimentary handles.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * &ldquo;Asi,&rdquo; &ldquo;Asîi,&rdquo; was at first sought for on the Asiatic
     continent&mdash;at Is on the Euphrates, or in Palestine: the
     discovery of the Canopic decree allows us to identify it
     with Cyprus, and this has now been generally done. The
     reading &ldquo;Asebi&rdquo; is still maintained by some.

    <p>
      The pottery is red or black in colour, and the ornamentation of it
      consists of incised geometrical designs. Copper and bronze, where we find
      examples of these metals, do not appear to have been employed in the
      manufacture of ornaments or arrow-heads, but usually in making daggers.
      There is no indication anywhere of foreign influence, and yet Cyprus had
      already at this time entered into relations with the civilized nations of
      the continent.* According to Chaldæan tradition, it was conquered about
      the year 3800 B.C. by Sargon of Agadê: without insisting upon the reality
      of this conquest, which in any case must have been ephemeral in its
      nature, there is reason to believe that the island was subjected from an
      early period to the influence of the various peoples which lived one after
      another on the slopes of the Lebanon. Popular legend attributes to King
      Kinyras and to the Giblites [i.e. the people of Byblos] the establishment
      of the first Phoenician colonies in the southern region of the island&mdash;one
      of them being at Paphos, where the worship of Adonis and Astartê continued
      to a very late date. The natives preserved their own language and customs,
      had their own chiefs, and maintained their national independence, while
      constrained to submit at the same time to the presence of Phoenician
      colonists or merchants on the coast, and in the neighbourhood of the mines
      in the mountains. The trading centres of these settlers&mdash;Kition,
      Amathus, Solius, Golgos, and Tamassos&mdash;were soon, however, converted
      into strongholds, which ensured to Phonicia the monopoly of the immense
      wealth contained in the island.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An examination into the origin of the Cypriotes formed
     part of the original scheme of this work, together with that
     of the monuments of the various races scattered along the
     coast of Asia Minor and the islands of the Ægean; but I
     have been obliged to curtail it, in order to keep within the
     limits I had proscribed for myself, and I have merely
     epitomised, as briefly as possible, the results of the
     researches undertaken in those regions during the last few
     years.

     ** The Phoenician origin of these towns is proved by
     passages from classical writers. The date of the
     colonisation is uncertain, but with the knowledge we possess
     of the efficient vessels belonging to the various Phoenician
     towns, it would seem difficult not to allow that the coasts
     at least of Cyprus must have been partially occupied at the
     time of the Egyptian invasions.
</pre>
    <p>
      Tyre and Sidon had no important centres of industry on that part of the
      Canaanite coast which extended to the south of Carmel, and Egypt, even in
      the time of the shepherd kings, would not have tolerated the existence on
      her territory of any great emporium not subject to the immediate
      supervision of her official agents. We know that the Libyan cliffs long
      presented an obstacle to inroads into Egyptian territory, and baffled any
      attempts to land to the westwards of the Delta: the Phoenicians
      consequently turned with all the greater ardour to those northern regions
      which for centuries had furnished them with most valuable products&mdash;bronze,
      tin, amber, and iron, both native and wrought. A little to the north of
      the Orontes, where the Syrian border is crossed and Asia Minor begins, the
      coast turns due west and runs in that direction for a considerable
      distance. The Phoenicians were accustomed to trade along this region, and
      we may attribute, perhaps, to them the foundation of those obscure cities&mdash;Kibyra,
      Masura, Euskopus, Sylion, Mygdalê, and Sidyma*&mdash;all of which
      preserved their apparently Semitic names down to the time of the Roman
      epoch. The whole of the important island of Rhodes fell into their power,
      and its three ports, Ialysos, Lindos*, and Kamiros, afforded them a
      well-situated base of operations for further colonisation. On leaving
      Rhodes, the choice of two routes presented itself to them. To the
      south-west they could see the distant outline of Karpathos, and on the far
      horizon behind it the summits of the Cretan chain. Crete itself bars on
      the south the entrance to the Ægean, and is almost a little continent,
      self-contained and self-sufficing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * No direct evidence exists to lead us to attribute the
     foundation of these towns to the Phoenicians, but the
     Semitic origin of nearly all the names is an uncontested
     fact.

      It is made up of fertile valleys and mountains clothed with forests, and
      its inhabitants could employ themselves in mines and fisheries. The
      Phoenicians effected a settlement on the coast at Itanos, at Kairatos, and
      at Arados, and obtained possession of the peak of Cythera, where, it is
      said, they raised a sanctuary to Astartê. If, on leaving Rhodes, they had
      chosen to steer due north, they would soon have come into contact with
      numerous rocky islets scattered in the sea between the continents of Asia
      and Europe, which would have furnished them with as many stations, less
      easy of attack, and more readily defended than posts on the mainland. Of
      these the Giblites occupied Melos, while the Sidonians chose Oliaros and
      Thera, and we find traces of them in every island where any natural
      product, such as metals, sulphur, alum, fuller&rsquo;s earth, emery, medicinal
      plants, and shells for producing dyes, offered an attraction. The purple
      used by the Tyrians for dyeing is secreted by several varieties of
      molluscs common in the Eastern Mediterranean; those most esteemed by the
      dyers were the <i>Murex trunculus</i> and the <i>Murex Brandaris</i>, and
      solid masses made up of the detritus of these shells are found in enormous
      quantities in the neighbourhood of many Phoenician towns. The colouring
      matter was secreted in the head of the shellfish. To obtain it the shell
      was broken by a blow from a hammer, and the small quantity of slightly
      yellowish liquid which issued from the fracture was carefully collected
      and stirred about in salt water for three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then boiled in leaden vessels and reduced by simmering over a slow
      fire; the remainder was strained through a cloth to free it from the
      particles of flesh still floating in it, and the material to be dyed was
      then plunged into the liquid. The usual tint thus imparted was that of
      fresh blood, in some lights almost approaching to black; but careful
      manipulation could produce shades of red, dark violet, and amethyst.
      Phoenician settlements can be traced, therefore, by the heaps of shells
      upon the shore, the Cyclades and the coasts of Greece being strewn with
      this refuse. The veins of gold in the Pangaion range in Macedonia
      attracted them off the Thracian coast* received also frequent visits from
      them, and they carried their explorations even through the tortuous
      channel of the Hellespont into the Propontis, drawn thither, no doubt by
      the silver mines in the Bithynian mountains** which were already being
      worked by Asiatic miners.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The fact that they worked the mines of Thasos is attested
     by Herodotus.

     ** Pronektos, on the Gulf of Ascania, was supposed to be a
     Phoenician colony.
</pre>
    <p>
      Beyond the calm waters of the Propontis, they encountered an obstacle to
      their progress in another narrow channel, having more the character of a
      wide river than of a strait; it was with difficulty that they could make
      their way against the violence of its current, which either tended to
      drive their vessels on shore, or to dash them against the reefs which
      hampered the navigation of the channel. When, however, they succeeded in
      making the passage safely, they found themselves upon a vast and stormy
      sea, whose wooded shores extended east and west as far as eye could reach.

      From the tribes who inhabited them, and who acted as intermediaries, the

      The peoples with whom they traded were not mere barbarians, contented with
      worthless objects of barter; their clients included the inhabitants of the
      iEgean, who, if inferior to the great nations of the East, possessed an
      independent and growing civilization, traces of which are still coming to
      light from many quarters in the shape of tombs, houses, palaces, utensils,
      ornaments, representations of the gods, and household and funerary
      furniture,&mdash;not only in the Cyclades, but on the mainland of Asia
      Minor and of Greece. No inferior goods or tinsel wares would have
      satisfied the luxurious princes who reigned in such ancient cities as Troy
      and Mycenae, and who wanted the best industrial products of Egypt and
      Syria&mdash;costly stuffs, rare furniture, ornate and well-wrought
      weapons, articles of jewellery, vases of curious and delicate design&mdash;such
      objects, in fact, as would have been found in use among the sovereigns and
      nobles of Memphis or of Babylon. For articles to offer in exchange they
      were not limited to the natural or roughly worked products of their own
      country. Their craftsmen, though less successful in general technique than
      their Oriental contemporaries, exhibited considerable artistic
      intelligence and an extraordinary manual skill. Accustomed at first merely
      to copy the objects sold to them by the Phoenicians, they soon developed a
      style of their own; the Mycenaean dagger in the illustration on page 299,
      though several centuries later in date than that of the Pharaoh Ahmosis,
      appears to be traceable to this ancient source of inspiration, although it
      gives evidence of new elements in its method of decoration and in its
      greater freedom of treatment. The inhabitants of the valleys of the Nile
      and of the Orontes, and probably also those of the Euphrates and Tigris,
      agreed in the, high value they set upon these artistic objects in gold,
      silver, and bronze, brought to them from the further shores of the
      Mediterranean, which, while reproducing their own designs, modified them
      to a certain extent; for just as we now imitate types of ornamental work
      in vogue among nations less civilized than ourselves, so the iEgean people
      set themselves the task through their potters and engravers of reproducing
      exotic models. The Phoenician traders who exported to Greece large
      consignments of objects made under various influences in their own
      workshops, or purchased in the bazaars of the ancient world, brought back
      as a return cargo an equivalent number of works of art, bought in the
      towns of the West, which eventually found their way into the various
      markets of Asia and Africa. These energetic merchants were not the first
      to ply this profitable trade of maritime carriers, for from the time of
      the Memphite empire the products of northern regions had found their way,
      through the intermediation of the Haûinibû, as far south as the cities of
      the Delta and the Thebaid. But this commerce could not be said to be
      either regular or continuous; the transmission was carried on from one
      neighbouring tribe to another, and the Syrian sailors were merely the last
      in a long chain of intermediaries&mdash;a tribal war, a migration, the
      caprice of some chief, being sufficient to break the communication, and
      even cause the suspension of transit for a considerable period. The
      Phoenicians desired to provide against such risks by undertaking
      themselves to fetch the much-coveted objects from their respective
      sources, or, where this was not possible, from the ports nearest the place
      of their manufacture. Reappearing with each returning year in the
      localities where they had established emporia, they accustomed the natives
      to collect against their arrival such products as they could profitably
      use in bartering with one or other of their many customers. They thus
      established, on a fixed line of route, a kind of maritime trading service,
      which placed all the shores of the Mediterranean in direct communication
      with each other, and promoted the blending of the youthful West with the
      ancient East.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Thûtmosis I. and his army&mdash;Hâtshopsîtû and Thûtmosis III.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The account of the first expedition undertaken by Thûtmosis in Asia, a
      region at that time new to the Egyptians, would be interesting if we could
      lay our hands upon it. We should perhaps find in the midst of official
      documents, or among the short phrases of funerary biographies, some
      indication of the impression which the country produced upon its
      conquerors.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of a few merchants or adventurers, no one from Thebes
      to Memphis had any other idea of Asia than that which could be gathered
      from the scattered notices of it in the semi-historical romances of the
      preceding age. The actual sight of the country must have been a
      revelation; everything appearing new and paradoxical to men of whom the
      majority had never left their fatherland, except on some warlike
      expedition into Ethiopia or on some rapid raid along the coasts of the Red
      Sea. Instead of their own narrow valley, extending between its two
      mountain ranges, and fertilised by the periodical overflowing of the Nile
      which recurred regularly almost to a day, they had before them wide
      irregular plains, owing their fertility not to inundations, but to
      occasional rains or the influence of insignificant streams; hills of
      varying heights covered with vines and other products of cultivation;
      mountains of different altitudes irregularly distributed, clothed with
      forests, furrowed with torrents, their summits often crowned with snow
      even in the hottest period of summer: and in this region of nature, where
      everything was strange to them, they found nations differing widely from
      each other in appearance and customs, towns with crenellated walls perched
      upon heights difficult of access; and finally, a civilization far
      excelling that which they encountered anywhere in Africa outside their own
      boundaries. Thûtmosis succeeded in reaching on his first expedition a
      limit which none of his successors was able to surpass, and the road taken
      by him in this campaign&mdash;from Gaza to Megiddo, from Megiddo to
      Qodshû, from Qodshû to Carchemish&mdash;was that which was followed
      henceforward by the Egyptian troops in all their expeditions to the
      Euphrates. Of the difficulties which he encountered on his way we have no
      information. On arriving at Naharaim, however, we know that he came into
      contact with the army of the enemy, which was under the command of a
      single general&mdash;perhaps the King of Mitanni himself, or one of the
      lieutenants of the &ldquo;Cossæan King of Babylon&rdquo;&mdash;who had collected
      together most of the petty princes of the northern country to resist the
      advance of the intruder. The contest was hotly fought out on both sides,
      but victory at length remained with the invaders, and innumerable
      prisoners fell into their hands. The veteran Âhmosi, son of Abîna, who was
      serving in his last campaign, and his cousin, Âhmosi Pannekhabît,
      distinguished themselves according to their wont. The former, having
      seized upon a chariot, brought it, with the three soldiers who occupied
      it, to the Pharaoh, and received once more &ldquo;the collar of gold;&rdquo; the
      latter killed twenty-one of the enemy, carrying off their hands as
      trophies, captured a chariot, took one prisoner, and obtained as reward a
      valuable collection of jewellery, consisting of collars, bracelets,
      sculptured lions, choice vases, and costly weapons. A stele, erected on
      the banks of the Euphrates not far from the scene of the battle, marked
      the spot which the conqueror wished to be recognised henceforth as the
      frontier of his empire. He re-entered Thebes with immense booty, by which
      gods as well as men profited, for he consecrated a part of it to the
      embellishment of the temple of Amon, and the sight of the spoil
      undoubtedly removed the lingering prejudices which the people had
      cherished against expeditions beyond the isthmus. Thûtmosis was held up by
      his subjects to the praise of posterity as having come into actual contact
      with that country and its people, which had hitherto been known to the
      Egyptians merely through the more or less veracious tales of exiles and
      travellers. The aspect of the great river of the Naharaim, which could be
      compared with the Nile for the volume of its waters, excited their
      admiration. They were, however, puzzled by the fact that it flowed from
      north to south, and even were accustomed to joke at the necessity of
      reversing the terms employed in Egypt to express going up or down the
      river. This first Syrian campaign became the model for most of those
      subsequently undertaken by the Pharaohs. It took the form of a bold
      advance of troops, directed from Zalû towards the north-east, in a
      diagonal line through the country, who routed on the way any armies which
      might be opposed to them, carrying by assault such towns as were easy of
      capture, while passing by others which seemed strongly defended&mdash;pillaging,
      burning, and slaying on every side. There was no suspension of
      hostilities, no going into winter quarters, but a triumphant return of the
      expedition at the end of four or five months, with the probability of
      having to begin fresh operations in the following year should the
      vanquished break out into revolt.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * From the account of the campaigns of Amenôthes II., I
     thought we might conclude that this Pharaoh wintered in
     Syria at least once; but the text does not admit of this
     interpretation, and we must, therefore, for the present give
     up the idea that the Pharaohs ever spent more than a few
     months of the year on hostile territory.
</pre>
    <p>
      The troops employed in these campaigns were superior to any others
      hitherto put into the field. The Egyptian army, inured to war by its long
      struggle with the Shepherd-kings, and kept in training since the reign of
      Âhmosis by having to repulse the perpetual incursions of the Ethiopian or
      Libyan barbarians, had no difficulty, in overcoming the Syrians; not that
      the latter were wanting in courage or discipline, but owing to their
      limited supply of recruits, and the political disintegration of the
      country, they could not readily place under arms such enormous numbers as
      those of the Egyptians. Egyptian military organisation had remained
      practically unchanged since early times: the army had always consisted,
      firstly, of the militia who held fiefs, and were under the obligation of
      personal service either to the prince of the nome or to the sovereign;
      secondly, of a permanent force, which was divided into two corps,
      distributed respectively between the Sa&rsquo;id and the Delta. Those companies
      which were quartered on the frontier, or about the king either at Thebes
      or at one of the royal residences, were bound to hold themselves in
      readiness to muster for a campaign at any given moment. The number of
      natives liable to be levied when occasion required, by &ldquo;generations,&rdquo; or
      as we should say by classes, may have amounted to over a hundred thousand
      men,* but they were never all called out, and it does not appear that the
      army on active service ever contained more than thirty thousand men at a
      time, and probably on ordinary occasions not much more than ten or fifteen
      thousand.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The only numbers which we know are those given by
     Herodotus for the Saïte period, which are evidently
     exaggerated. Coming down to modern times, we see that
     Mehemet-Ali, from 1830 to 1840, had nearly 120,000 men in
     Syria, Egypt, and the Sudan; and in 1841, at the time when
     the treaties imposed upon him the ill-kept obligation of
     reducing his army to 18,000 men, it still contained 81,000.
     We shall probably not be far wrong in estimating the total
     force which the Pharaohs of the XVIIIth dynasty, lords of
     the whole valley of the Nile, and of part of Asia, had at
     their disposal at 120,000 or 130,000 men; these, however,
     were never all called out at once.

     ** We have no direct information respecting the armies
     acting in Syria; we only know that, at the battle of Qodshû,
     Ramses II. had against him 2500 chariots containing three
     men each, making 7500 charioteers, besides a troop estimated
     at the Ramesseum at 8000 men, at Luxor at 9000, so that the
     Syrian army probably contained about 20,000 men. It would
     seem that the Egyptian army was less numerous, and I
     estimate it with great hesitation at about 15,000 or 18,000
     men: it was considered a powerful army, while that of the
     Hittites was regarded as an innumerable host. A passage in
     the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, tells us the composition of a
     corps led by Ramses II. against the tribes in the vicinity
     of Qocoîr and the Rahanû valley; it consisted of 5000 men,
     of whom 620 were Shardana, 1600 Qahak, 70 Mashaûasha, and
     880 Negroes.
</pre>
    <p>
      The infantry was, as we should expect, composed of troops of the line and
      light troops. The former wore either short wigs arranged in rows of curls,
      or a kind of padded cap by way of a helmet, thick enough to deaden blows;
      the breast and shoulders were undefended, but a short loin-cloth was
      wrapped round the hips, and the stomach and upper part of the thighs were
      protected by a sort of triangular apron, sometimes scalloped at the sides,
      and composed of leather thongs attached to a belt. A buckler of moderate
      dimensions had been substituted for the gigantic shield of the earlier
      Theban period; it was rounded at the top and often furnished with a solid
      metal boss, which the experienced soldiers always endeavoured to present
      to the enemy&rsquo;s lances and javelins. Their weapons consisted of pikes about
      five feet long, with broad bronze or copper points, occasionally of
      flails, axes, daggers, short curved swords, and spears; the trumpeters
      were armed with daggers only, and the officers did not as a rule encumber
      themselves with either buckler or pike, but bore and axe and dagger, an
      occasionally a bow.

</pre>
    <p>
      The light infantry was composed chiefly of bowmen&mdash;<i>pidâtû</i>&mdash;the
      celebrated archers of Egypt, whose long bows and arrows, used with deadly
      skill, speedily became renowned throughout the East; the quiver, of the
      use of which their ancestors were ignorant, had been borrowed from the
      Asiatics, probably from the Hyksôs, and was carried hanging at the side or
      slung over the shoulder. Both spearmen and archers were for the most part
      pure-bred Egyptians, and were divided into regiments of unequal strength,
      each of which usually bore the name of some god&mdash;as, for example, the
      regiment of Ra or of Phtah, of Arnon or of Sûtkhû*&mdash;in which the
      feudal contingents, each commanded by its lord or his lieutenants, fought
      side by side with the king&rsquo;s soldiers furnished from the royal domains.
      The effective force of the army was made up by auxiliaries taken from the
      tribes of the Sahara and from the negroes of the Upper Nile.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The army of Ramses II. at the battle of Qodshû comprised
     four corps, which bore the names of Amon, Râ, Phtah, and
     Sûtkhû. Other lesser corps were named the <i>Tribe of
     Pharaoh,</i> the <i>Tribe of the Beauty of the Solar dish.</i>
     These, as far as I can judge, must have been troops raised
     on the royal domains by a system of local recruiting, who
     were united by certain common privileges and duties which
     constituted them an hereditary militia, whence they were
     called <i>tribes</i>.

     ** These Ethiopian recruits are occasionally represented in
     the Theban tombs of the XVIIIth dynasty, among others in the
     tomb of Pahsûkhîr.
</pre>
    <p>
      These auxiliaries were but sparingly employed in early times, but their
      numbers were increased as wars became more frequent and necessitated more
      troops to carry them on. The tribes from which they were drawn supplied
      the Pharaohs with an inexhaustible reserve; they were courageous, active,
      indefatigable, and inured to hardships, and if it had not been for their
      turbulent nature, which incited them to continual internal dissensions,
      they might readily have shaken off the yoke of the Egyptians. Incorporated
      into the Egyptian army, and placed under the instruction of picked
      officers, who subjected them to rigorous discipline, and accustomed them
      to the evolutions of regular troops, they were transformed from
      disorganised hordes into tried and invincible battalions.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The armies of Hâtshopsîtû already included Libyan
     auxiliaries, some of which are represented at Deîr el-
     Baharî; others of Asiatic origin are found under Amenôthes
     IV., but they are not represented on the monuments among the
     regular troops until the reign of Ramses II., when the
     Shardana appear for the first time among the king&rsquo;s body-
     guard.

      The old army, which had conquered Nubia in the days of the Papis and
      Usirtasens, had consisted of these three varieties of foot-soldiers only,
      but since the invasion of the Shepherds, a new element had been
      incorporated into the modern army in the-shape of the chariotry, which
      answered to some extent to the cavalry of our day as regards their
      tactical employment and efficacy. The horse, when once introduced into
      Egypt, soon became fairly adapted to its environment. It retained both its
      height and size, keeping the convex forehead&mdash;which gave the head a
      slightly curved profile&mdash;the slender neck, the narrow hind-quarters,
      the lean and sinewy legs, and the long flowing tail which had
      characterised it in its native country. The climate, however, was
      enervating, and constant care had to be taken, by the introduction of new
      blood from Syria, to prevent the breed from deteriorating.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The numbers of horses brought from Syria either as spoils
     of war or as tribute paid by the vanquished are frequently
     recorded in the Annals of Thûtmosis III. Besides the usual
     species, powerful stallions were imported from Northern
     Syria, which were known by the Semitic name of Abîri, the
     strong. In the tombs of the XVIIIth dynasty, the arrival of
     Syrian horses in Egypt is sometimes represented.

      The Pharaohs kept studs of horses in the principal cities of the Nile
      valley, and the great feudal lords, following their example, vied with
      each other in the possession of numerous breeding stables. The office of
      superintendent to these establishments, which was at the disposal of the
      Master of the Horse, became in later times one of the most important State
      appointments.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the story of the conquest of Egypt by the Ethiopian
     Piônkhi, studs are indicated at Hermopolis, at Athribis, in
     the towns to the east and in the centre of the Delta, and at
     Sais. Diodorus Siculus relates that, in his time, the
     foundations of 100 stables, each capable of containing 200
     horses, were still to be seen on the western bank of the
     river between Memphis and Thebes.

      The first chariots introduced into Egypt were, like the horses, of foreign
      origin, but when built by Egyptian workmen they soon became more elegant,
      if not stronger than their models. Lightness was the quality chiefly aimed
      at; and at length the weight was so reduced that it was possible for a man
      to carry his chariot on his shoulders without fatigue. The materials for
      them were on this account limited to oak or ash and leather; metal,
      whether gold or silver, iron or bronze, being used but sparingly, and then
      only for purposes of ornamentation. The wheels usually had six, but
      sometimes eight spokes, or occasionally only four. The axle consisted of a
      single stout pole of acacia. The framework of the chariot was composed of
      two pieces of wood mortised together so as to form a semicircle or
      half-ellipse, and closed by a straight bar; to this frame was fixed a
      floor of sycomore wood or of plaited leather thongs. The sides of the
      chariot were formed of upright panels, solid in front and open at the
      sides, each provided with a handrail. The pole, which was of a single
      piece of wood, was bent into an elbow at about one-fifth of its length
      from the end, which was inserted into the centre of the axletree. On the
      gigantic T thus formed was fixed the body of the chariot, the hinder part
      resting on the axle, and the front attached to the bent part of the pole,
      while the whole was firmly bound together with double leather thongs. A
      yoke of hornbeam, shaped like a bow, to which the horses were harnessed,
      was fastened to the other extremity of the pole. The Asiatics placed three
      men in a chariot, but the Egyptians only two; the warrior&mdash;<i>sinni</i>&mdash;whose
      business it was to fight, and the shield-bearer&mdash;<i>qazana</i>&mdash;who
      protected his companion with a buckler during the engagement. A complete
      set of weapons was carried in the chariot&mdash;lances, javelins, and
      daggers, curved spear, club, and battle-axe&mdash;while two bow-cases as
      well as two large quivers were hung at the sides. The chariot itself was
      very liable to upset, the slightest cause being sufficient to overturn it.
      Even when moving at a slow pace, the least inequality of the ground shook
      it terribly, and when driven at full speed it was only by a miracle of
      skill that the occupants could maintain their equilibrium. At such times
      the charioteer would stand astride of the front panels, keeping his right
      foot only inside the vehicle, and planting the other firmly on the pole,
      so as to lessen the jolting, and to secure a wider base on which to
      balance himself. To carry all this into practice long education was
      necessary, for which there were special schools of instruction, and those
      who were destined to enter the army were sent to these schools when little
      more than children. To each man, as soon as he had thoroughly mastered all
      the difficulties of the profession, a regulation chariot and pair of
      horses were granted, for which he was responsible to the Pharaoh or to his
      generals, and he might then return to his home until the next call to
      arms. The warrior took precedence of the shield-bearer, and both were
      considered superior to the foot-soldier; the chariotry, in fact, like the
      cavalry of the present day, was the aristocratic branch of the army, in
      which the royal princes, together with the nobles and their sons,
      enlisted. No Egyptian ever willingly trusted himself to the back of a
      horse, and it was only in the thick of a battle, when his chariot was
      broken, and there seemed no other way of escaping from the mêlée, that a
      warrior would venture to mount one of his steeds. There appear, however,
      to have been here and there a few horsemen, who acted as couriers or
      aides-de-camp; they used neither saddle-cloth nor stirrups, but were
      provided with reins with which to guide their animals, and their seat on
      horseback was even less secure than the footing of the driver in his
      chariot.

      The infantry was divided into platoons of six to ten men each, commanded
      by an officer and marshalled round an ensign, which represented either a
      sacred animal, an emblem of the king or of his double, or a divine figure
      placed upon the top of a pike; this constituted an object of worship to
      the group of soldiers to whom it belonged. We are unable to ascertain how
      many of these platoons, either of infantry or of chariotry, went to form a
      company or a battalion, or by what ensigns the different grades were
      distinguished from each other, or what was their relative order of rank.
      Bodies of men, to the number of forty or fifty, are sometimes represented
      on the monuments, but this may be merely by chance, or because the
      draughtsman did not take the trouble to give the proper number accurately.
      The inferior officers were equipped very much like the soldiers, with the
      exception of the buckler, which they do not appear to have carried, and
      certainly did not when on the march: the superior officers might be known
      by their umbrella or flabellum, a distinction which gave them the right of
      approaching the king&rsquo;s person.

      The military exercises to which all these troops were accustomed probably
      differed but little from those which were in vogue with the armies of the
      Ancient Empire; they consisted in wrestling, boxing, jumping, running
      either singly or in line at regular distances from each other, manual
      exercises, fencing, and shooting at a target; the war-dance had ceased to
      be in use among the Egyptian regiments as a military exercise, but it was
      practised by the Ethiopian and Libyan auxiliaries. At the beginning of
      each campaign, the men destined to serve in it were called out by the
      military scribes, who supplied them with arms from the royal arsenals.
      Then followed the distribution of rations. The soldiers, each carrying a
      small linen bag, came up in squads before the commissariat officers, and
      each received his own allowance.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We see the distribution of arms made by the scribes and
     other officials of the royal arsenals represented in the
     pictures at Medinet-Abu. The calling out of the classes was

     well as the distribution of supplies.

      Once in the enemy&rsquo;s country the army advanced in close order, the infantry
      in columns of four, the officers in rear, and the chariots either on the
      right or left flank, or in the intervals between divisions. Skirmishers
      thrown out to the front cleared the line of march, while detached parties,
      pushing right and left, collected supplies of cattle, grain, or
      drinking-water from the fields and unprotected villages. The main body was
      followed by the baggage train; it comprised not only supplies and stores,
      but cooking-utensils, coverings, and the entire paraphernalia of the
      carpenters&rsquo; and blacksmiths&rsquo; shops necessary for repairing bows, lances,
      daggers, and chariot-poles, the whole being piled up in four-wheeled carts
      drawn by asses or oxen. The army was accompanied by a swarm of
      non-combatants, scribes, soothsayers, priests, heralds, musicians,
      servants, and women of loose life, who were a serious cause of
      embarrassment to the generals, and a source of perpetual danger to
      military discipline. At nightfall they halted in a village, or more
      frequently bivouacked in an entrenched camp, marked out to suit the
      circumstances of the case. This entrenchment was always rectangular, its
      length being twice as great as its width, and was surrounded by a ditch,
      the earth from which, being banked up on the inside, formed a rampart from
      five to six feet in height; the exterior of this was then entirely faced
      with shields, square below, but circular in shape at the top. The entrance
      to the camp was by a single gate in one of the longer sides, and a plank
      served as a bridge across the trench, close to which two detachments
      mounted guard, armed with clubs and naked swords.

      The royal quarters were situated at one end of the camp. Here, within an
      enclosure, rose an immense tent, where the Pharaoh found all the luxury to
      which he was accustomed in his palaces, even to a portable chapel, in
      which each morning he could pour out water and burn incense to his father,
      Amon-Râ of Thebes. The princes of the blood who formed his escort, his
      shield-bearers and his generals, were crowded together hard by, and
      beyond, in closely packed lines, were the horses and chariots, the draught
      bullocks, the workshops and the stores.

      The soldiers, accustomed from childhood to live in the open air, erected
      no tents or huts of boughs for themselves in these temporary encampments,
      but bivouacked in the open, and the sculptures on the façades of the
      Theban pylons give us a minute picture of the way in which they employed
      themselves when off duty. Here one man, while cleaning his armour,
      superintends the cooking. Another, similarly engaged, drinks from a skin
      of wine held up by a slave. A third has taken his chariot to pieces, and t
      is replacing some portion the worse for wear. Some are sharpening their
      daggers or lances; others mend their loin-cloths or sandals, or exchange
      blows with fists and sticks. The baggage, linen, arms, and provisions are
      piled in disorder on the ground; horses, oxen, and asses are eating or
      chewing the cud at their ease; while here and there a donkey, relieved of
      his burden, rolls himself on the ground and brays with delight.*

      The success of the Egyptians in battle was due more to the courage and
      hardihood of the men than to the strategical skill of their commanders. We
      find no trace of manouvres, in the sense in which we understand the word,
      either in their histories or on their bas-reliefs, but they joined battle
      boldly with the enemy, and the result was decided by a more or less bloody
      conflict. The heavy infantry was placed in the centre, the chariots were
      massed on the flanks, while light troops thrown out to the front began the
      action by letting fly volleys of arrows and stones, which through the
      skill of the bowmen and slingers did deadly execution; then the pikemen
      laid their spears in rest, and pressing straight forward, threw their
      whole weight against the opposing troops. At the same moment the
      charioteers set off at a gentle trot, and gradually quickened their pace
      till they dashed at full speed upon the foe, amid the confused rumbling of
      wheels and the sharp clash of metal.

      The Egyptians, accustomed by long drilling to the performance of such
      evolutions, executed these charges as methodically as though they were
      still on their parade-ground at Thebes; if the disposition of the ground
      were at all favourable, not a single chariot would break the line, and the
      columns would sweep across the field without swerving or falling into
      disorder. The charioteer had the reins tied round his body, and could, by
      throwing his weight either to the right or the left, or by slackening or
      increasing the pressure through a backward or forward motion, turn, pull
      up, or start his horses by a simple movement of the loins: he went into
      battle with bent bow, the string drawn back to his ear, the arrow levelled
      ready to let fly, while the shield-bearer, clinging to the body of the
      chariot with one hand, held out his buckler with the other to shelter his
      comrade. It would seem that the Syrians were less skilful; their bows did
      not carry so far as those of their adversaries, and consequently they came
      within the enemy&rsquo;s range some moments before it was possible for them to
      return the volley with effect. Their horses would be thrown down, their
      drivers would fall wounded, and the disabled chariots would check the
      approach of those following and overturn them, so that by the time the
      main body came up with the enemy the slaughter would have been serious
      enough to render victory hopeless. Nevertheless, more than one charge
      would be necessary finally to overturn or scatter the Syrian chariots,
      which, once accomplished, the Egyptian charioteer would turn against the
      foot-soldiers, and, breaking up their ranks, would tread them down under
      the feet of his horses.*

      Nor did the Pharaoh spare himself in the fight; his splendid dress, the
      urasus on his forehead, and the nodding plumes of his horses made him a
      mark for the blows of the enemy, and he would often find himself in
      positions of serious danger. In a few hours, as a rule, the conflict would
      come to an end.

      Once the enemy showed signs of giving way, the Egyptian chariots dashed
      upon them precipitously, and turned the retreat into a rout: the pursuit
      was, however, never a long One; some fortress was always to be found close
      at hand where the remnant of the defeated host could take refuge.* The
      victors, moreover, would be too eager to secure the booty, and to strip
      the bodies of the dead, to allow time for following up the foe.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * After the battle of Megiddo, the remnants of the Syrian
     army took refuge in the city, where Thûtmosis III. besieged
     them; similarly under Ramses II. the Hittite princes took
     refuge in Qodshû after their defeat.
</pre>
    <p>
      The prisoners were driven along in platoons, their arms bound in strange
      and contorted attitudes, each under the charge of his captor; then came
      the chariots, arms, slaves, and provisions collected on the battle-field
      or in the camp, then other trophies of a kind unknown in modern warfare.
      When an Egyptian killed or mortally wounded any one, he cut off, not the
      head, but the right hand or the phallus, and brought it to the royal
      scribes. These made an accurate inventory of everything, and even Pharaoh
      did not disdain to be present at the registration. The booty did not
      belong to the persons who obtained it, but was thrown into a common stock
      which was placed at the disposal of the sovereign: one part he reserved
      for the gods, especially for his father Amon of Thebes, who had given him
      the victory; another part he kept for himself, and the remainder was
      distributed among his army. Each man received a reward in proportion to
      his rank and services, such as male or female slaves, bracelets,
      necklaces, arms, vases, or a certain measured weight of gold, known as the
      &ldquo;gold of bravery.&rdquo; A similar sharing of the spoil took place after every
      successful engagement: from Pharaoh to the meanest camp-follower, every
      man who had contributed to the success of a campaign returned home richer
      than he had set out, and the profits which he derived from a war were a
      liberal compensation for the expenses in which it had involved him.

      The results of the first expedition of Thûtmosis I. were of a decisive
      character; so much so, indeed, that he never again, it would seem, found
      it necessary during the remainder of his life to pass the isthmus.
      Northern Syria, it is true, did not remain long under tribute, if indeed
      it paid any at all after the departure of the Egyptians, but the southern
      part of the country, feeling itself in the grip of the new master,
      accepted its defeat: Gaza became the head-quarters of a garrison which
      secured the door of Asia for future invasion,* and Pharaoh, freed from
      anxiety in this quarter, gave his whole time to the consolidation of his
      power in Ethiopia.

     we may infer it, however, from the way in which Thûtmosis
     III. tells how he reached Gaza without opposition at the
     beginning of his first campaign, and celebrated the
     anniversary of his coronation there. On the other hand, we
     learn from details in the lists that the mountains and
     plains beyond Gaza were in a state of open rebellion.
</pre>
    <p>
      The river and desert tribes of this region soon forgot the severe lesson
      which he had given them: as soon as the last Egyptian soldier had left
      their territory they rebelled once more, and began a fresh series of
      inroads which had to be repressed anew year after year. Thûtmosis I. had
      several times to drive them back in the years II. and III., but was able
      to make short work of their rebellions. An inscription at Tombos on the
      Nile, in the very midst of the disturbed districts, told them in brave
      words what he was, and what he had done since he had come to the throne.
      Wherever he had gone, weapon in hand, &ldquo;seeking a warrior, he had found
      none to withstand him; he had penetrated to valleys which were unknown to
      his ancestors, the inhabitants of which had never beheld the wearers of
      the double diadem.&rdquo; All this would have produced but little effect had he
      not backed up his words by deeds, and taken decisive measures to restrain
      the insolence of the barbarians. Tombos lies opposite to Hannek, at the
      entrance to that series of rapids known as the Third Cataract. The course
      of the Nile is here barred by a formidable dyke of granite, through which
      it has hollowed out six winding channels of varying widths, dotted here
      and there with huge polished boulders and verdant islets. When the
      inundation is at its height, the rocks are covered and the rapids
      disappear, with the exception of the lowest, which is named Lokoli, where
      faint eddies mark the place of the more dangerous reefs; and were it not
      that the fall here is rather more pronounced and the current somewhat
      stronger, few would suspect the existence of a cataract at the spot. As
      the waters go down, however, the channels gradually reappear. When the
      river is at its lowest, the three westernmost channels dry up almost
      completely, leaving nothing but a series of shallow pools; those on the
      east still maintain their flow, but only one of them, that between the
      islands of Tombos and Abadîn, remains navigable. Here Thûtmosis built,
      under invocation of the gods of Heliopolis, one of those brickwork
      citadels, with its rectangular keep, which set at nought all the efforts
      and all the military science of the Ethiopians: attached to it was a
      harbour, where each vessel on its way downstream put in for the purpose of
      hiring a pilot.*
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarchs of the XIIth and XIIIth dynasties had raised fortifications
      at the approaches to Wady Haifa, and their engineers skilfully chose the
      sites so as completely to protect from the ravages of the Nubian pirates
      that part of the Nile which lay between Wady Haifa and Philse.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The foundation of this fortress is indicated in an
     emphatic manner in the Tombos inscription: &ldquo;The masters of
     the Great Castle (the gods of Heliopolis) have made a
     fortress for the soldiers of the king, which the nine
     peoples of Nubia combined could not carry by storm, for,
     like a young panther before a bull which lowers its head,
     the souls of his Majesty have blinded them with
     fear.&rdquo; Quarries of considerable size, where Cailliaud
     imagined he could distinguish an overturned colossus, show
     the importance which the establishment had attained in
     ancient times; the ruins of the town cover a fairly large
     area near the modern village of Kerman.
</pre>
    <p>
      Henceforward the garrison at Tombos was able to defend the mighty curve
      described by the river through the desert of Mahas, together with the
      island of Argo, and the confines of Dongola. The distance between Thebes
      and this southern frontier was a long one, and communication was slow
      during the winter months, when the subsidence of the waters had rendered
      the task of navigation difficult for the Egyptian ships. The king was
      obliged, besides, to concentrate his attention mainly on Asiatic affairs,
      and was no longer able to watch the movements of the African races with
      the same vigilance as his predecessors had exercised before Egyptian
      armies had made their way as far as the banks of the Euphrates. Thutmosis
      placed the control of the countries south of Assuan in the hands of a
      viceroy, who, invested with the august title of &ldquo;Royal Son of Kûsh,&rdquo; must
      have been regarded as having the blood of Râ himself running in his
      veins.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The meaning of this title was at first misunderstood.
     Champollion and Rosellini took it literally, and thought it
     referred to Ethiopian princes, who were vassals or enemies
     of Egypt. Birch persists in regarding them as Ethiopians
     driven out by their subjects, restored by the Pharaohs as
     viceroys, while admitting that they may have belonged to the
     solar family.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sura, the first of these viceroys whose name has reached us, was in office
      at the beginning of the campaign of the year III.* He belonged, it would
      seem, to a Theban family, and for several centuries afterwards his
      successors are mentioned among the nobles who were in the habit of
      attending the court. Their powers were considerable: they commanded
      armies, built or restored temples, administered justice, and received the
      homage of loyal sheikhs or the submission of rebellious ones.** The period
      for which they were appointed was not fixed by law, and they held office
      simply at the king&rsquo;s pleasure. During the XIXth dynasty it was usual to
      confer this office, the highest in the state, on a son of the sovereign,
      preferably the heir-apparent. Occasionally his appointment was purely
      formal, and he continued in attendance on his father, while a trusty
      substitute ruled in his place: often, however, he took the government on
      himself, and in the regions of the Upper Nile served an apprenticeship to
      the art of ruling.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * He is mentioned in the Sehêl inscriptions as &ldquo;the royal
     son Sura.&rdquo; Nahi, who had been regarded as the first holder of
     the office, and who was still in office under Thutmosis
     III., had been appointed by Thutmosis I., but after Sura.

     ** Under Thutmosis III., the viceroy Nahi restored the
     temple at Semneh; under Tutankhamon, the viceroy Hui
     received tribute from the Ethiopian princes, and presented
     them to the sovereign.

      This district was in a perpetual state of war&mdash;a war without danger,
      but full of trickery and surprises: here he prepared himself for the
      larger arena of the Syrian campaigns, learning the arts of generalship
      more perfectly than was possible in the manouvres of the parade-ground.
      Moreover, the appointment was dictated by religious as well as by
      political considerations. The presumptive heir to the throne was to his
      father what Horus had been to Osiris&mdash;his lawful successor, or, if
      need be, his avenger, should some act of treason impose on him the duty of
      vengeance: and was it not in Ethiopia that Horus had gained his first
      victories over Typhon? To begin like Horus, and flesh his maiden steel on
      the descendants of the accomplices of Sit, was, in the case of the future
      sovereign, equivalent to affirming from the outset the reality of his
      divine extraction.*

      As at the commencement of the Theban dynasties, it was the river valley
      only in these regions of the Upper Nile which belonged to the Pharaohs.
      From this time onward it gave support to an Egyptian population as far as
      the juncture of the two Niles: it was a second Egypt, but a poorer one,
      whose cities presented the same impoverished appearance as that which we
      find to-day in the towns of Nubia. The tribes scattered right and left in
      the desert, or distributed beyond the confluence of the two Niles among
      the plains of Sennar, were descended from the old indigenous races, and
      paid valuable tribute every year in precious metals, ivory, timber, or the
      natural products of their districts, under penalty of armed invasion.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The tribute of the Ganbâtiû, or people of the south, and
          that of Kûsh and of the Ûaûaîû, is mentioned repeatedly
          in the <i>Annales de Thûtmosis III.</i> for the year XXXI.,
          for the year XXXIII., and for the year XXXIV. The
          regularity with which this item recurs, unaccompanied by
          any mention of war, following after each Syrian campaign,
          shows that it was an habitual operation which was
          registered as an understood thing. True, the inscription
          does not give the item for every year, but then it only
          dealt with Ethiopian affairs in so far as they were
          subsidiary to events in Asia; the payment was none the
          less an annual one, the amount varying in accordance with
          local agreement.
</pre>
    <p>
      Among these races were still to be found descendants of the Mazaiû and
      Ûaûaîû, who in days gone by had opposed the advance of the victorious
      Egyptians: the name of the Uaûaîû was, indeed, used as a generic term to
      distinguish all those tribes which frequented the mountains between the
      Nile and the Red Sea,* but the wave of conquest had passed far beyond the
      boundaries reached in early campaigns, and had brought the Egyptians into
      contact with nations with whom they had been in only indirect commercial
      relations in former times.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Annals of Thûtmosis III. mention the tribute of Pûanît
     for the peoples of the coast, the tribute of Uaûaît for the
     peoples of the mountain between the Nile and the sea, the
     tribute of Kûsh for the peoples of the south, or Ganbâtiû.

      Some of these were light-coloured men of a type similar to that of the
      modern Abyssinians or Gallas: they had the same haughty and imperious
      carriage, the same well-developed and powerful frames, and the same love
      of fighting. Most of the remaining tribes were of black blood, and such of
      them as we see depicted on the monuments resemble closely the negroes
      inhabiting Central Africa at the present day.

      They have the same elongated skull, the low prominent forehead, hollow
      temples, short flattened nose, thick lips, broad shoulders, and salient
      breast, the latter contrasting sharply with the undeveloped appearance of
      the lower part of the body, which terminates in thin legs almost devoid of
      calves. Egyptian civilization had already penetrated among these tribes,
      and, as far as dress and demeanour were concerned, their chiefs differed
      in no way from the great lords who formed the escort of the Pharaoh. We
      see these provincial dignitaries represented in the white robe and
      petticoat of starched, pleated, and gauffered linen; an innate taste for
      bright colours, even in those early times, being betrayed by the red or
      yellow scarf in which they wrapped themselves, passing it over one
      shoulder and round the waist, whence the ends depended and formed a kind
      of apron. A panther&rsquo;s skin covered the back, and one or two
      ostrich-feathers waved from the top of the head or were fastened on one
      side to the fillet confining the hair, which was arranged in short curls
      and locks, stiffened with gum and matted with grease, so as to form a sort
      of cap or grotesque aureole round the skull. The men delighted to load
      themselves with rings, bracelets, earrings, and necklaces, while from
      their arms, necks, and belts hung long strings of glass beads, which
      jingled with every movement of the wearer. They seem to have frequently
      chosen a woman as their ruler, and her dress appears to have closely
      resembled that of the Egyptian ladies. She appeared before her subjects in
      a chariot drawn by oxen, and protected from the sun by an umbrella edged
      with fringe. The common people went about nearly naked, having merely a
      loin-cloth of some woven stuff or an animal&rsquo;s skin thrown round their
      hips. Their heads were either shaven, or adorned with tufts of hair
      stiffened with gum. The children of both sexes wore no clothes until the
      age of puberty; the women wrapped themselves in a rude garment or in a
      covering of linen, and carried their children on the hip or in a basket of
      esparto grass on the back, supported by a leather band which passed across
      the forehead. One characteristic of all these tribes was their love of
      singing and dancing, and their use of the drum and cymbals; they were
      active and industrious, and carefully cultivated the rich soil of the
      plain, devoting themselves to the raising of cattle, particularly of oxen,
      whose horns they were accustomed to train fantastically into the shapes of
      lyres, bows, and spirals, with bifurcations at the ends, or with small
      human figures as terminations. As in the case of other negro tribes, they
      plied the blacksmith&rsquo;s and also the goldsmith&rsquo;s trade, working up both
      gold and silver into rings, chains, and quaintly shaped vases, some
      specimens of their art being little else than toys, similar in design to
      those which delighted the Byzantine Caesars of later date.

      A wall-painting remains of a gold epergne, which represents men and
      monkeys engaged in gathering the fruit of a group of dôm-palms. Two
      individuals lead each a tame giraffe by the halter, others kneeling on the
      rim raise their hands to implore mercy from an unseen enemy, while negro
      prisoners, grovelling on their stomachs, painfully attempt to raise their
      head and shoulders from the ground. This, doubtless, represents a scene
      from the everyday life of the people of the Upper Nile, and gives a
      faithful picture of what took place among many of its tribes during a
      rapid inroad of some viceroy of Kush or a raid by his lieutenants.

    <p>
      The resources which Thûtmosis I. was able to draw regularly from these
      southern regions, in addition to the wealth collected during his Syrian
      campaign, enabled him to give a great impulse to building work. The
      tutelary deity of his capital&mdash;Amon-Râ&mdash;who had ensured him the
      victory in all his battles, had a prior claim on the bulk of the spoil; he
      received it as a matter of course, and his temple at Thebes was thereby
      considerably enlarged; we are not, however, able to estimate exactly what
      proportion fell to other cities, such as Kummeh, Elephantine,* Abydos,**
      and Memphis, where a few scattered blocks of stone still bear the name of
      the king. Troubles broke out in Lower Egypt, but they were speedily
      subdued by Thûtmosis, and he was able to end his days in the enjoyment of
      a profound peace, undisturbed by any care save that of ensuring a regular
      succession to his throne, and of restraining the ambitions of those who
      looked to become possessed of his heritage.***

     *** The expressions from which we
     gather that his reign was disturbed
     by outbreaks of internal rebellion
     seem to refer to a period subsequent

     Hâtshopsîtû.
</pre>
    <p>
      His position was, indeed, a curious one; although <i>de facto</i> absolute
      in power, his children by Queen Ahmasi took precedence of him, for by her
      mother&rsquo;s descent she had a better right to the crown than her husband, and
      legally the king should have retired in favour of hie sons as soon as they
      were old enough to reign. The eldest of them, Uazmosû, died early.* The
      second, Amenmosu, lived at least to attain adolescence; he was allowed to
      share the crown with his father from the fourth year of the latter&rsquo;s
      reign, and he also held a military command in the Delta,** but before long
      he also died, and Thûtmosis I. was left with only one son&mdash;a
      Thûtmosis like himself&mdash;to succeed him. The mother of this prince was
      a certain Mûtnofrit,*** half-sister to the king on his father&rsquo;s side, who
      enjoyed such a high rank in the royal family that her husband allowed her
      to be portrayed in royal dress; her pedigree on the mother&rsquo;s side,
      however, was not so distinguished, and precluded her son from being
      recognised as heir-apparent, hence the occupation of the &ldquo;seat of Horus&rdquo;
       reverted once more to a woman, Hâtshopsîtû, the eldest daughter of Âhmasi.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Uazmosû is represented on the tomb of Pahiri at El-Kab,
     where Mr. Griffith imagines he can trace two distinct
     Uazmosû; for the present, I am of opinion that there was but
     one, the son of Thûtmosis I. His funerary chapel was
     discovered at Thebes; it is in a very bad state of
     preservation.

     ** Amenmosû is represented at El-Kab, by the side of his
     brother Uazmosû. Also on a fragment where we find him, in
     the fourth year of his father&rsquo;s reign, honoured with a
     cartouche at Memphis, and consequently associated with his
     father in the royal power.

     *** Mûtnofrit was supposed by Mariette to have been a
     daughter of Thûtmosis II; the statue reproduced on p. 345
     has shown us that she was wife of Thûtmosis I. and mother of
     Thûtmosis II.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hâtshopsîtû herself was not, however, of purely divine descent. Her
      maternal ancestor, Sonisonbû, had not been a scion of the royal house, and
      this flaw in her pedigree threatened to mar, in her case, the sanctity of
      the solar blood. According to Egyptian belief, this defect of birth could
      only be remedied by a miracle,* and the ancestral god, becoming incarnate
      in the earthly father at the moment of conception, had to condescend to
      infuse fresh virtue into his race in this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      * A similar instance of divine substitution is known to us in the case of
      two other sovereigns, viz. Amenôthes III., whose father, Titmosis IV., was
      born under conditions analogous to those attending the birth of Thûtmosis
      I.; and Ptolemy Caesarion, whose father, Julius Cæsar, was not of Egyptian
      blood.

      The inscriptions with which Hâtshopsîtû decorated her chapel relate how,
      on that fateful night, Amon descended upon Ahmasi in a flood of perfume
      and light. The queen received him favourably, and the divine spouse on
      leaving her announced to her the approaching birth of a daughter, in whom
      his valour and strength should be manifested once more here below. The
      sequel of the story is displayed in a series of pictures before our eyes.

      The protecting divinities who preside over the birth of children conduct
      the queen to her couch, and the sorrowful resignation depicted on her
      face, together with the languid grace of her whole figure, display in this
      portrait of her a finished work of art. The child enters the world amid
      shouts of joy, and the propitious genii who nourish both her and her
      double constitute themselves her nurses. At the appointed time, her
      earthly father summons the great nobles to a solemn festival, and presents
      to them his daughter, who is to reign with him over Egypt and the world.*

     is now in the Berlin Museum. The fragment has undergone

      She retained, however, the feminine pronoun in speaking of herself, and
      also an epithet, inserted in her cartouche, which declared her to be the
      betrothed of Amon&mdash;khnûmît Amaûnû.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We know how greatly puzzled the early Egyptologists were
     by this manner of depicting the queen, and how Champollion,
     in striving to explain the monuments of the period, was
     driven to suggest the existence of a regent, Amenenthes, the
     male counterpart and husband of Hâtshopsîtû, whose name he
     read Amense. This hypothesis, adopted by Rosellini, with
     some slight modifications, was rejected by Birch. This
     latter writer pointed out the identity of the two personages
     separated by Champollion, and proved them to be one and the
     same queen, the Amenses of Manetho; he called her Amûn-nûm-
     hc, but he made her out to be a sister of Amenôthes I.,
     associated on the throne with her brothers Thûtmosis I. and
     Thûtmosis IL, and regent at the beginning of the reign of
     Thûtmosis III. Hineks tried to show that she was the
     daughter of Thûtmosis I., the wife of Thûtmosis II. and the
     sister of Thûtmosis III.; it is only quite recently that her
     true descent and place in the family tree has been
     recognised. She was, not the sister, but the aunt of
     Thûtmosis III. The queen, called by Birch Amûn-nûm-het, the
     latter part of her name being dropped and the royal prenomen
     being joined to her own name, was subsequently styled Ha-asû
     or Hatasû, and this form is still adopted by some writers;
     the true reading is Hâtshopsîtû or Hâtshopsîtû, then
     Hâtshopsîû, or Hâtshepsîû, as Naville has pointed out.
</pre>
    <p>
      Her father united her while still young to her brother Thûtmosis, who
      appears to have been her junior, and this fact doubtless explains the very
      subordinate part which he plays beside the queen. When Thûtmosis I. died,
      Egyptian etiquette demanded that a man should be at the head of affairs,
      and this youth succeeded his father in office: but Hâtshopsîtû, while
      relinquishing the semblance of power and the externals of pomp to her
      husband,* kept the direction of the state entirely in her own hands. The
      portraits of her which have been preserved represent her as having refined
      features, with a proud and energetic expression. The oval of the face is
      elongated, the cheeks a little hollow, and the eyes deep set under the
      arch of the brow, while the lips are thin and tightly closed.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is evident, from the expressions employed by Thûtmosis
     I. in associating his daughter with himself on the throne,
     that she was unmarried at the time, and Naville thinks that
     she married her brother Thûtmosis II. after the death of her
     father. It appears to me more probable that Thûtmosis I.
     married her to her brother after she had been raised to the
     throne, with a view to avoiding complications which might
     have arisen in the royal family after his own death. The
     inscription at Shutt-er-Ragel, which has furnished Mariette
     with the hypothesis that Thûtmosis I. and Thûtmosis IL
     reigned simultaneously, proves that the person mentioned in
     it, a certain Penaîti, flourished under both these Pharaohs,
     but by no means shows that these two reigned together; he
     exercised the functions which he held by their authority
     during their successive reigns.

      She governed with so firm a hand that neither Egypt nor its foreign
      vassals dared to make any serious attempt to withdraw themselves from her
      authority. One raid, in which several prisoners were taken, punished a
      rising of the Shaûsû in Central Syria, while the usual expeditions
      maintained order among the peoples of Ethiopia, and quenched any attempt
      which they might make to revolt. When in the second year of his reign the
      news was brought to Thutmosis II. that the inhabitants of the Upper Nile
      had ceased to observe the conditions which his father had imposed upon
      them, he &ldquo;became furious as a panther,&rdquo; and assembling his troops set out
      for war without further delay. The presence of the king with the army
      filled the rebels with dismay, and a campaign of a few weeks put an end to
      their attempt at rebelling.

      The earlier kings of the XVIIIth dynasty had chosen for their last
      resting-place a spot on the left bank of the Nile at Thebes, where the
      cultivated land joined the desert, close to the pyramids built by their
      predecessors. Probably, after the burial of Amenôthes, the space was fully
      occupied, for Thutmosis I. had to seek his burying-ground some way up the
      ravine, the mouth of which was blocked by their monuments. The Libyan
      chain here forms a kind of amphitheatre of vertical cliffs, which descend
      to within some ninety feet of the valley, where a sloping mass of detritus
      connects them by a gentle declivity with the plain.

      The great lords and the queens in the times of the Antufs and the
      Usirtasens had taken possession of this spot, but their chapels were by
      this period in ruins, and their tombs almost all lay buried under the
      waves of sand which the wind from the desert drives perpetually over the
      summit of the cliffs. This site was seized on by the architects of
      Thûtmosis, who laid there the foundations of a building which was destined
      to be unique in the world. Its ground plan consisted of an avenue of
      sphinxes, starting from the plain and running between the tombs till it
      reached a large courtyard, terminated on the west by a colonnade, which
      was supported by a double row of pillars.

      Above and beyond this was the vast middle platform,* connected with the
      upper court by the central causeway which ran through it from end to end;
      this middle platform, like that below it, was terminated on the west by a
      double colonnade, through which access was gained to two chapels hollowed
      out of the mountain-side, while on the north it was bordered with
      excellent effect by a line of proto-Dorio columns ranged against the face
      of the cliff.

     temple is that used in the <i>Guide to Deir el-Bahari</i>,

</pre>
    <p>
      This northern colonnade was never completed, but the existing part is of
      as exquisite proportions as anything that Greek art has ever produced. At
      length we reach the upper platform, a nearly square courtyard, cutting on
      one side into the mountain slope, the opposite side being enclosed by a
      wall pierced by a single door, while to right and left ran two lines of
      buildings destined for purposes connected with the daily worship of the
      temple. The sanctuary was cut out of the solid rock, but the walls were
      faced with white limestone; some of the chambers are vaulted, and all of
      them decorated with bas-reliefs of exquisite workmanship, perhaps the
      finest examples of this period. Thûtmosis I. scarcely did more than lay
      the foundations of this magnificent building, but his mummy was buried in
      it with great pomp, to remain there until a period of disturbance and
      general insecurity obliged those in charge of the necropolis to remove the
      body, together with those of his family, to some securer hiding-place.*
      The king was already advanced in age at the time of his death, being over
      fifty years old, to judge by the incisor teeth, which are worn and
      corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Both E. de Rougé and Mariette were opposed to the view
     that the temple was founded by Thûtmosis I., and Naville
     agrees with them. Judging from the many new texts discovered
     by Naville, I am inclined to think that Thûtmosis I. began
     the structure, but from plans, it would appear, which had
     not been so fully developed as they afterwards became. Prom
     indications to be found here and there in the inscriptions
     of the Ramesside period, I am not, moreover, inclined to
     regard Deîr el-Bâhâri as the funerary chapel of tombs which
     were situated in some unknown place elsewhere, but I believe
     that it included the burial-places of Thûtmosis I.,
     Thûtmosis II., Queen Hâtshopsîtû, and of numerous
     representatives of their family; indeed, it is probable that
     Thûtmosis III. and his children found here also their last
     resting-place.

      His statues bear the same expression, which indeed is that of the mummy
      itself. He resembles Thûtmosis I., but his features are not so marked, and
      are characterised by greater gentleness. He had scarcely reached the age
      of thirty when he fell a victim to a disease of which the process of
      embalming could not remove the traces. The skin is scabrous in patches,
      and covered with scars, while the upper part of the skull is bald; the
      body is thin and somewhat shrunken, and appears to have lacked vigour and
      muscular power. By his marriage with his sister, Thûtmosis left daughters
      only,* but he had one son, also a Thûtmosis, by a woman of low birth,
      perhaps merely a slave, whose name was Isis.** Hâtshopsîtû proclaimed this
      child her successor, for his youth and humble parentage could not excite
      her jealousy. She betrothed him to her one surviving daughter, Hâtshopsîtû
      II., and having thus settled the succession in the male line, she
      continued to rule alone in the name of her nephew who was still a minor,
      as she had done formerly in the case of her half-brother.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Two daughters of Queen Hâtshopsîtû I. are known, of whom
     one, Nofîrûrî, died young, and Hâtshopsîtû II. Marîtrî, who
     was married to her half-brother on her father&rsquo;s side,
     Thûtmosis III., who was thus her cousin as well. Amenôthes
     II. was offspring of this marriage.

     ** The name of the mother of Thûtmosis III. was revealed to
     us on the wrappings found with the mummy of this king in the
     hiding-place of Deîr el-Baharî; the absence of princely
     titles, while it shows the humble extraction of the lady
     Isis, explains at the same time the somewhat obscure
     relations between Hâtshopsîtû and her nephew.

      Her reign was a prosperous one, but whether the flourishing condition of
      things was owing to the ability of her political administration or to her
      fortunate choice of ministers, we are unable to tell. She pressed forward
      the work of building with great activity, under the direction of her
      architect Sanmût, not only at Deîr el-Baharî, but at Karnak, and indeed
      everywhere in Thebes. The plans of the building had been arranged under
      Thûtmosis I., and their execution had been carried out so quickly, that in
      many cases the queen had merely to see to the sculptural ornamentation on
      the all but completed walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      This work, however, afforded her sufficient excuse, according to Egyptian
      custom, to attribute the whole structure to herself, and the opinion she
      had of her own powers is exhibited with great naiveness in her
      inscriptions. She loves to pose as premeditating her actions long
      beforehand, and as never venturing on the smallest undertaking without
      reference to her divine father.

      This is what I teach to mortals who shall live in centuries to come, and
      whose hearts shall inquire concerning the monument which I have raised to
      my father, speaking and exclaiming as they contemplate it: as for me, when
      I sat in the palace and thought upon him who created me, my heart prompted
      me to raise to him two obelisks of electrum, whose apices should pierce
      the firmaments, before the noble gateway which is between the two great
      pylons of the King Thûtmosis I. And my heart led me to address these words
      to those who shall see my monuments in after-years and who shall speak of
      my great deeds: Beware of saying, &lsquo;I know not, I know not why it was
      resolved to carve this mountain wholly of gold!&rsquo; These two obelisks, My
      Majesty has made them of electrum for my father Anion, that my name may
      remain and live on in this temple for ever and ever; for this single block
      of granite has been cut, without let or obstacle, at the desire of My
      Majesty, between the first of the second month of Pirîfc of the Vth year,
      and the 30th of the fourth month of Shomû of the VIth year, which makes
      seven months from the day when they began to, quarry it. One of these two
      monoliths is still standing among the ruins of Karnak, and the grace of
      its outline, the finish of its hieroglyphics, and the beauty of the
      figures which cover it, amply justify the pride which the queen and her
      brother felt in contemplating it.

      Later on, in the the queen&rsquo;s reign, Amon enjoined a work which was more
      difficult to carry out. On a day when Hâtshopsîtû had gone to the temple
      to offer prayers, &ldquo;her supplications arose up before the throne of the
      Lord of Karnak, and a command was heard in the sanctuary, a behest of the
      god himself, that the ways which lead to Pûanît should be explored, and
      that the roads to the &lsquo;Ladders of Incense&rsquo; should be trodden.&rdquo; *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The word &ldquo;Ladders&rdquo; is the translation of the Egyptian word
     &ldquo;Khâtiû,&rdquo; employed in the text to designate the country laid
     out in terraces where the incense trees grew; cf. with a
     different meaning, the &ldquo;ladders&rdquo; of the eastern
     Mediterranean.

      Gums required for the temple service had hitherto reached the Theban
      priests solely by means of foreign intermediaries; so that in the slow
      transport across Africa they lost much of their freshness, besides being
      defiled by passing through impure hands. In addition to these drawbacks,
      the merchants confounded under the one term &ldquo;Anîti&rdquo; substances which
      differed considerably both in value and character, several of them,
      indeed, scarcely coming under the category of perfumes, and hence being
      unacceptable to the gods. One kind, however, found favour with them above
      all others, being that which still abounds in Somali-land at the present
      day&mdash;a gum secreted by the incense sycomore.*

     other products also, which they confounded together under

      It was accounted a pious work to send and obtain it direct from the
      locality in which it grew, and if possible to procure the plants
      themselves for acclimatisation in the Nile valley. But the relations
      maintained in former times with the people of these aromatic regions had
      been suspended for centuries. &ldquo;None now climbed the &lsquo;Ladders of Incense,&rsquo;
      none of the Egyptians; they knew of them from hearsay, from the stories of
      people of ancient times, for these products were brought to the kings of
      the Delta, thy fathers, to one or other of them, from the times of thy
      ancestors the kings of the Said who lived of yore.&rdquo; All that could be
      recalled of this country was summed up in the facts, that it lay to the
      south or to the extreme east, that from thence many of the gods had come
      into Egypt, while from out of it the sun rose anew every morning. Amon, in
      his omniscience, took upon himself to describe it and give an exact
      account of its position. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Ladders of Incense&rsquo; is a secret province of
      Tonûtir, it is in truth a place of delight. I created it, and I thereto
      lead Thy Majesty, together with Mût, Hâthor, Uîrît, the Lady of Pûanît,
      Uîrît-hikaû, the magician and regent of the gods, that the aromatic gum
      may be gathered at will, that the vessels may be laden joyfully with
      living incense trees and with all the products of this earth.&rdquo; Hâtshopsîtû
      chose out five well-built galleys, and manned them with picked crews. She
      caused them to be laden with such merchandise as would be most attractive
      to the barbarians, and placing the vessels under the command of a royal
      envoy, she sent them forth on the Bed Sea in quest of the incense.

      We are not acquainted with the name of the port from which the fleet set
      sail, nor do we know the number of weeks it took to reach the land of
      Pûanît, neither is there any record of the incidents which befell it by
      the way. It sailed past the places frequented by the mariners of the XIIth
      dynasty&mdash;Suakîn, Massowah, and the islands of the Ked Sea; it touched
      at the country of the Ilîm which lay to the west of the Bab el-Mandeb,
      went safely through the Straits, and landed at last in the Land of
      Perfumes on the Somali coast.* There, between the bay of Zeîlah and Bas
      Hafun, stretched the Barbaric region, frequented in later times by the
      merchants of Myos Hormos and of Berenice.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * That part of Pûanît where the Egyptians landed was at
     first located in Arabia by Brugsch, then transferred to
     Somali-land by Mariette, whose opinion was accepted by most
     Egyptologists. Dumichen, basing his hypothesis on a passage
     where Pûanît is mentioned as &ldquo;being on both sides of the
     sea,&rdquo; desired to apply the name to the Arabian as well as to
     the African coast, to Yemen and Hadhramaut as well as to
     Somali-land; this suggestion was adopted by Lieblein, and
     subsequently by Ed. Meyer, who believed that its inhabitants
     were the ancestors of the Sabseans. Since then Krall has
     endeavoured to shorten the distance between this country and
     Egypt, and he places the Pûanît of Hâtshopsîtû between
     Suakin and Massowah. This was, indeed, the part of the
     country known under the XIIth dynasty at the time when it
     was believed that the Nile emptied itself thereabouts into
     the Red Sea, in the vicinity of the Island of the Serpent
     King, but I hold, with Mariette, that the Pûanît where the
     Egyptians of Hâtshopsîtû&rsquo;s time landed is the present
     Somali-land&mdash;a view which is also shared by Navillo, but
     which Brugsch, in the latter years of his life, abandoned.

      The first stations which the latter encountered beyond Cape Direh&mdash;Avails,
      Malao, Mundos, and Mosylon&mdash;were merely open roadsteads offering no
      secure shelter; but beyond Mosylon, the classical navigators reported the
      existence of several wadys, the last of which, the Elephant River, lying
      between Bas el-Eîl and Cape Guardafui, appears to have been large enough
      not only to afford anchorage to several vessels of light draught, but to
      permit of their performing easily any evolutions required. During the
      Roman period, it was there, and there only, that the best kind of incense
      could be obtained, and it was probably at this point also that the
      Egyptians of Hâtshopsîtû&rsquo;s time landed. The Egyptian vessels sailed up the
      river till they reached a place beyond the influence of the tide, and then
      dropped anchor in front of a village scattered along a bank fringed with
      sycomores and palms.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * I have shown, from a careful examination of the bas-
     reliefs, that the Egyptians must have landed, not on the
     coast itself, as was at first believed, but in the estuary
     of a river, and this observation has been accepted as
     decisive by most Egyptologists; besides this, newly
     discovered fragments show the presence of a hippopotamus.
     Since then I have sought to identify the landing-place of
     the Egyptians with the most important of the creeks
     mentioned by the Græco-Roman merchants as accessible for
     their vessels, viz. that which they called the Elephant
     River, near to the present Ras el-Fîl.

      The huts of the inhabitants were of circular shape, each being surmounted
      with a conical roof; some of them were made of closely plaited osiers, and
      there was no opening in any of them save the door. They were built upon
      piles, as a protection from the rise of the river and from wild animals,
      and access to them was gained by means of moveable ladders. Oxen chewing
      the cud rested beneath them. The natives belonged to a light-coloured
      race, and the portraits we possess of them resemble the Egyptian type in
      every particular. They were tall and thin, and of a colour which varied
      between brick-red and the darkest brown. Their beards were pointed, and
      the hair was cut short in some instances, while in others it was arranged
      in close rows of curls or in small plaits. The costume of the men
      consisted of a loin-cloth only, while the dress of the women was a yellow
      garment without sleeves, drawn in at the waist and falling halfway below
      the knee.

      The royal envoy landed under an escort of eight soldiers and an officer,
      but, to prove his pacific intentions, he spread out upon a low table a
      variety of presents, consisting of five bracelets two gold necklaces, a
      dagger with strap and sheath complete, a battle-axe, and eleven strings of
      glass beads.

      The inhabitants, dazzled by the display of so many valuable objects, ran
      to meet the new-comers, headed by their sheikh, and expressed a natural
      astonishment at the sight of the strangers. &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo; they exclaimed,
      &ldquo;that you have reached this country hitherto unknown to men? Have you come
      down by way of the sky, or have you sailed on the waters of the Tonûtir
      Sea? You have followed the path of the sun, for as for the king of the
      land of Egypt, it is not possible to elude him, and we live, yea, we
      ourselves, by the breath which he gives us.&rdquo; The name of their chief was
      Parihû, who was distinguished from his subjects by the boomerang which he
      carried, and also by his dagger and necklace of beads: his right leg,
      moreover, appears to have been covered with a kind of sheath composed of
      rings of some yellow metal, probably gold.* He was accompanied by his wife
      Ati, riding on an ass, from which she alighted in order to gain a closer
      view of the strangers. She was endowed with a type of beauty much admired
      by the people of Central Africa, being so inordinately fat that the shape
      of her body was scarcely recognisable under the rolls of flesh which hung
      down from it. Her daughter, who appeared to be still young, gave promise
      of one day rivalling, if not exceeding, her mother in size.**

     * Mariette compares this kind of armour to the &ldquo;dangabor&rdquo; of

     Livingstone saw a woman, the sister of Sebituaneh, the
     highest lady of the Sesketeh, who wore on each leg eighteen
     rings of solid brass as thick as the finger, and three rings
     of copper above the knee. The weight of these shining rings
     impeded her walking, and produced sores on her ankles; but
     it was the fashion, and the inconvenience became nothing. As
     to the pain, it was relieved by a bit of rag applied to the
     lower rings.

     earliest with which we are acquainted.

      After an exchange of compliments, the more serious business of the
      expedition was introduced. The Egyptians pitched a tent, in which they
      placed the objects of barter with which they were provided, and to prevent
      these from being too great a temptation to the natives, they surrounded
      the tent with a line of troops.

      The main conditions of the exchange were arranged at a banquet, in which
      they spread before the barbarians a sumptuous display of Egyptian
      delicacies, consisting of bread, beer, wine, meat, and carefully prepared
      and flavoured vegetables. Payment for every object was to be made at the
      actual moment of purchase. For several days there was a constant stream of
      people, and asses groaned beneath their burdens. The Egyptian purchases
      comprised the most varied objects: ivory tusks, gold, ebony, cassia,
      myrrh, cynocephali and green monkeys, greyhounds, leopard skins, large
      oxen, slaves, and last, but not least, thirty-one incense trees, with
      their roots surrounded by a ball of earth and placed in large baskets. The
      lading of the ships was a long and tedious affair. All available space
      being at length exhausted, and as much cargo placed on board as was
      compatible with the navigation of the vessel, the squadron set sail and
      with all speed took its way northwards.

      The Egyptians touched at several places on the coast on their return
      journey, making friendly alliances with the inhabitants; the Him added a
      quota to their freight, for which room was with difficulty found on board,&mdash;it
      consisted not only of the inevitable gold, ivory, and skins, but also of
      live leopards and a giraffe, together with plants and fruits unknown on
      the banks of the Nile.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Lieblein thought that their country was explored, not by
     the sailors who voyaged to Pûanît, but by a different body
     who proceeded by land, and this view was accepted by Ed.
     Meyer. The completed text proves that there was but a single
     expedition, and that the explorers of Pûanît visited the
     Ilîm also. The giraffe which they gave does not appear in
     the cargo of the vessels at Pûanît; the visit must,
     therefore, have been paid on the return voyage, and the
     giraffe was probably represented on the destroyed part of
     the walls where Naville found the image of this animal
     wandering at liberty among the woods.
</pre>
    <p>
      The fleet at length made its reappearance in Egyptian ports, having on
      board the chiefs of several tribes on whose coasts the sailors had landed,
      and &ldquo;bringing back so much that the like had never been brought of the
      products of Pûanît to other kings, by the supreme favour of the venerable
      god, Amon Râ, lord of Karnak.&rdquo; The chiefs mentioned were probably young
      men of superior family, who had been confided to the officer in command of
      the squadron by local sheikhs, as pledges to the Pharaoh of good will or
      as commercial hostages. National vanity, no doubt, prompted the Egyptians
      to regard them as vassals coming to do homage, and their gifts as tributes
      denoting subjection. The Queen inaugurated a solemn festival in honour of
      the explorers. The Theban militia was ordered out to meet them, the royal
      flotilla escorting them as far as the temple landing-place, where a
      procession was formed to carry the spoil to the feet of the god. The good
      Theban folk, assembled to witness their arrival, beheld the march past of
      the native hostages, the incense sycomores, the precious gum itself, the
      wild animals, the giraffe, and the oxen, whose numbers were doubtless
      increased a hundredfold in the accounts given to posterity with the usual
      official exaggeration. The trees were planted at Deîr el-Baharî, where a
      sacred garden was prepared for them, square trenches being cut in the rock
      and filled with earth, in which the sycomore, by frequent watering, came
      to flourish well.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Naville found these trenches still filled with vegetable
     mould, and in several of them roots, which gave every
     indication of the purpose to which the trenches were
     applied. A scene represents seven of the incense sycomores
     still growing in their pots, and offered by the queen to the
     Majesty &ldquo;of this god Amonrâ of Karnak.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The great heaps of fresh resin were next the objects of special attention.
      Hâtshopsîtû &ldquo;gave a bushel made of electrum to gauge the mass of gum, it
      being the first time that they had the joy of measuring the perfumes for
      Amon, lord of Karnak, master of heaven, and of presenting to him the
      wonderful products of Pûanît. Thot, the lord of Hermo-polis, noted the
      quantities in writing; Safkhîtâbûi verified the list. Her Majesty herself
      prepared from it, with her own hands, a perfumed unguent for her limbs;
      she gave forth the smell of the divine dew, her perfume reached even to
      Pûanît, her skin became like wrought gold,* and her countenance shone like
      the stars in the great festival hall, in the sight of the whole earth.&rdquo;

      Hâtshopsîtû commanded the history of the expedition to be carved on the
      wall of the colonnades which lay on the west side of the middle platform
      of her funerary chapel: we there see the little fleet with sails spread,
      winging its way to the unknown country, its safe arrival at its
      destination, the meeting with the natives, the animated palavering, the
      consent to exchange freely accorded; and thanks to the minuteness with
      which the smallest details have been portrayed, we can as it were witness,
      as if on the spot, all the phases of life on board ship, not only on
      Egyptian vessels, but, as we may infer, those of other Oriental nations
      generally. For we may be tolerably sure that when the Phoenicians ventured
      into the distant parts of the Mediterranean, it was after a similar
      fashion that they managed and armed their vessels.

      Although the natural features of the Asiatic or Greek coast on which they
      effected a landing differed widely from those of Pûanît, the Phoenician
      navigators were themselves provided with similar objects of exchange, and
      in their commercial dealings with the natives the methods of procedure of
      the European traders were doubtless similar to those of the Egyptians with
      the barbarians of the Red Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hâtshopsîtû reigned for at least eight years after this memorable
      expedition, and traces of her further activity are to be observed in every
      part of the Nile valley. She even turned her attention to the Delta, and
      began the task of reorganising this part of her kingdom, which had been
      much neglected by her predecessors. The wars between the Theban princes
      and the lords of Avaris had lasted over a century, and during that time no
      one had had either sufficient initiative or leisure to superintend the
      public works, which were more needed here than in any other part of Egypt.
      The canals were silted up with mud, the marshes and the desert had
      encroached on the cultivated lands, the towns had become impoverished, and
      there were some provinces whose population consisted solely of shepherds
      and bandits. Hâtshopsîtû desired to remedy these evils, if only for the
      purpose of providing a practicable road for her armies marching to Zalû <i>en
      route</i> for Syria.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This follows from the great inscription at Stabl-Antar,
     which is commonly interpreted as proving that the Shepherd-
     kings still held sway in Egypt in the reign of Thûtmosis
     III., and that they were driven out by him and his aunt. It
     seems to me that the queen is simply boasting that she had
     repaired the monuments which had been injured by the
     Shepherds during the time they sojourned in Egypt, in the
     land of Avaris. Up to the present time no trace of these
     restorations has been found on the sites. The expedition to
     Pûanît being mentioned in lines 13, 14, they must be of
     later date than the year IX. of Hâtshopsîtû and Thûtmosis
     III.
</pre>
    <p>
      She also turned her attention to the mines of Sinai, which had not been
      worked by the Egyptian kings since the end of the XIIth dynasty. In the
      year XVI. an officer of the queen&rsquo;s household was despatched to the Wady
      Magharah, the site of the ancient works, with orders to inspect the
      valleys, examine the veins, and restore there the temple of the goddess
      Hâthor; having accomplished his mission, he returned, bringing with him a
      consignment of those blue and green stones which were so highly esteemed
      by the Egyptians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Thûtmosis III. was approaching manhood, and his aunt, the
      queen, instead of abdicating in his favour, associated him with herself
      more frequently in the external acts of government.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The account of the youth of Thûtmosis III., such as
     Brugsch made it out to be from an inscription of this king,
     the exile of the royal child at Bûto, his long sojourn in
     the marshes, his triumphal return, must all be rejected.
     Brugsch accepted as actual history a poetical passage where
     the king identifies himself with Horus son of Isis, and
     goes so far as to attribute to himself the adventures of the
     god.

      She was forced to yield him precedence in those religious ceremonies which
      could be performed by a man only, such as the dedication of one of the
      city gates of Ombos, and the foundation and marking out of a temple at
      Medinet-Habû; but for the most part she obliged him to remain in the
      background and take a secondary place beside her. We are unable to
      determine the precise moment when this dual sovereignty came to an end. It
      was still existent in the XVIth year of the reign, but it had ceased
      before the XXIInd year. Death alone could take the sceptre from the hands
      that held it, and Thûtmosis had to curb his impatience for many a long day
      before becoming the real master of Egypt. He was about twenty-five years
      of age when this event took place, and he immediately revenged himself for
      the long repression he had undergone, by endeavouring to destroy the very
      remembrance of her whom he regarded as a usurper. Every portrait of her
      that he could deface without exposing himself to being accused of
      sacrilege was cut away, and he substituted for her name either that of
      Thûtmosis I. or of Thûtmosis II.

      A complete political change was effected both at home and abroad from the
      first day of his accession to power. Hâtshopsîtû had been averse to war.
      During the whole of her reign there had not been a single campaign
      undertaken beyond the isthmus of Suez, and by the end of her life she had
      lost nearly all that her father had gained in Syria; the people of Kharu
      had shaken off the yoke,* probably at the instigation of the king of the
      Amorites,** and nothing remained to Egypt of the Asiatic province but
      Gaza, Sharûhana,*** and the neighbouring villages. The young king set out
      with his army in the latter days of the year XXII. He reached Gaza on the
      3rd of the month of Pakhons, in time to keep the anniversary of his
      coronation in that town, and to inaugurate the 24th year of his reign by
      festivals in honour of his father Amon.**** They lasted the usual length
      of time, and all the departments of State took part in them, but it was
      not a propitious moment for lengthy ceremonies.

     * E. de Rougé thought that he had discovered, in a slightly
     damaged inscription bearing upon the Pûanît expedition, the
     mention of a tribute paid by the Lotanû. There is nothing in
     the passage cited but the mention of the usual annual dues
     paid by the chiefs of Pûanît and of the Ilîm.

     ** This is at least what may be inferred from the account of
     the campaign, where the Prince of Qodshû, a town of the
     Amaûru (Amorites), figures at the head of the coalition
     formed against Thûtmosis III.

     *** This is the conclusion to be adopted from the beginning
     of the inscription of Thûtmosis III.: &ldquo;Now, during the
     duration of these same years, the country of the Lotanû was
     in discord until other times succeeded them, when the people
     who were in the town of Sharûhana, from the town of Yûrza,
     to the most distant regions of the earth, succeeded in
     making a revolt against his Majesty.&rdquo;

      The king left Gaza the following day, the 5th of Pakhons; he marched but
      slowly at first, following the usual caravan route, and despatching troops
      right and left to levy contributions on the cities of the Plain&mdash;Migdol,
      Yapu (Jaffa), Lotanû, Ono&mdash;and those within reach on the mountain
      spurs, or situated within the easily accessible wadys, such as Sauka
      (Socho), Hadid, and Harîlu. On the 16th day he had not proceeded further
      than Yahmu, where he received information which caused him to push quickly
      forward. The lord of Qodshû had formed an alliance with the Syrian princes
      on the borders of Naharaim, and had extorted from them promises of help;
      he had already gone so far as to summon contingents from the Upper
      Orontes, the Litany, and the Upper Jordan, and was concentrating them at
      Megiddo, where he proposed to stop the way of the invading army. Thûtmosis
      called together his principal officers, and having imparted the news to
      them, took counsel with them as to a plan of attack. Three alternative
      routes were open to him. The most direct approached the enemy&rsquo;s position
      on the front, crossing Mount Carmel by the saddle now known as the Umm
      el-Fahm; but the great drawback attached to this route was its being so
      restricted that the troops would be forced to advance in too thin a file;
      and the head of the column would reach the plain and come into actual
      conflict with the enemy while the rear-guard would only be entering the
      defiles in the neighbourhood of Aluna. The second route bore a little to
      the east, crossing the mountains beyond Dutîna and reaching the plain near
      Taânach; but it offered the same disadvantages as the other. The third
      road ran north of <i>Zafîti</i>, to meet the great highway which cuts the
      hill-district of Nablûs, skirting the foot of Tabor near Jenîn, a little
      to the north of Megiddo. It was not so direct as the other two, but it was
      easier for troops, and the king&rsquo;s generals advised that it should be
      followed. The king was so incensed that he was tempted to attribute their
      prudence to cowardice. &ldquo;By my life! by the love that Râ hath for me, by
      the favour that I enjoy from my master Amon, by the perpetual youth of my
      nostril in life and power, My Majesty will go by the way of Aluna, and let
      him that will go by the roads of which ye have spoken, and let him that
      will follow My Majesty. What will be said among the vile enemies detested
      of Râ: &lsquo;Doth not His Majesty go by another way? For fear of us he gives us
      a wide berth,&rsquo; they will cry.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s counsellors did not insist
      further. &ldquo;May thy father Amon of Thebes protect thee!&rdquo; they exclaimed; &ldquo;as
      for us, we will follow Thy Majesty whithersoever thou goest, as it
      befitteth a servant to follow his master.&rdquo; The word of command was given
      to the men; Thûtmosis himself led the vanguard, and the whole army,
      horsemen and foot-soldiers, followed in single file, wending their way
      through the thickets which covered the southern slopes of Mount Carmel.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The position of the towns mentioned and of the three roads
     has been discussed by E. de Rougé, also by P. de Saulcy, who
     fixed the position of Yahmu at El-Kheimeh, and showed that
     the Egyptian army must have passed through the defiles of
     Umm el-Rahm. Conder disagreed with this opinion in certain
     respects, and identified Aluna, Aruna, at first with
     Arrabeh, and afterwards with Arraneh; he thought that
     Thûtmosis came out upon Megiddo from the south-east, and he
     placed Megiddo at Mejeddah, near Beisan, while Tomkins
     placed Aruna in the Wady el-Arriân. W. Max Millier seems to
     place Yahinu too much to the north, in the neighbourhood of
     Jett.
</pre>
    <p>
      They pitched their camp on the evening of the 19th near Aluna, and on the
      morning of the 20th they entered the wild defiles through which it was
      necessary to pass in order to reach the enemy. The king had taken
      precautionary measures against any possible attempt of the natives to cut
      the main column during this crossing of the mountains. His position might
      at any moment have become a critical one, had the allies taken advantage
      of it and attacked each battalion as it issued on to the plain before it
      could re-form. But the Prince of Qodshû, either from ignorance of his
      adversary&rsquo;s movements, or confident of victory in the open, declined to
      take the initiative. Towards one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the Egyptians
      found themselves once more united on the further side of the range, close
      to a torrent called the Qina, a little to the south of Megiddo. When the
      camp was pitched, Thûtmosis announced his intention of engaging the enemy
      on the morrow. A council of war was held to decide on the position that
      each corps should occupy, after which the officers returned to their men
      to see that a liberal supply of rations was served out, and to organise an
      efficient system of patrols. They passed round the camp to the cry: &ldquo;Keep
      a good heart: courage! Watch well, watch well! Keep alive in the camp!&rdquo;
       The king refused to retire to rest until he had been assured that &ldquo;the
      country was quiet, and also the host, both to south and north.&rdquo; By dawn
      the next day the whole army was in motion. It was formed into a single
      line, the right wing protected by the torrent, the left extended into the
      plain, stretching beyond Megiddo towards the north-west. Thûtmosis and his
      guards occupied the centre, standing &ldquo;armed in his chariot of electrum
      like unto Horus brandishing his pike, and like Montû the Theban god.&rdquo; The
      Syrians, who had not expected such an early attack, were seized with
      panic, and fled in the direction of the town, leaving their horses and
      chariots on the field; but the citizens, fearing lest in the confusion the
      Egyptians should effect an entrance with the fugitives, had closed their
      gates and refused to open them. Some of the townspeople, however, let down
      ropes to the leaders of the allied party, and drew them up to the top of
      the ramparts: &ldquo;and would to heaven that the soldiers of His Majesty had
      not so far forgotten themselves as to gather up the spoil left by the vile
      enemy! They would then have entered Megiddo forthwith; for while the men
      of the garrison were drawing up the Lord of Qodshû and their own prince,
      the fear of His Majesty was upon their limbs, and their hands failed them
      by reason of the carnage which the royal urous carried into their ranks.&rdquo;
       The victorious soldiery were dispersed over the fields, gathering together
      the gilded and silvered chariots of the Syrian chiefs, collecting the
      scattered weapons and the hands of the slain, and securing the prisoners;
      then rallying about the king, they greeted him with acclamations and filed
      past to deliver up the spoil. He reproached them for having allowed
      themselves to be drawn away from the heat of pursuit. &ldquo;Had you carried
      Megiddo, it would have been a favour granted to me by Râ my father this
      day; for all the kings of the country being shut up within it, it would
      have been as the taking of a thousand towns to have seized Megiddo.&rdquo; The
      Egyptians had made little progress in the art of besieging a stronghold
      since the times of the XIIth dynasty. When scaling failed, they had no
      other resource than a blockade, and even the most stubborn of the Pharaohs
      would naturally shrink from the tedium of such an undertaking. Thûtmosis,
      however, was not inclined to lose the opportunity of closing the campaign
      by a decisive blow, and began the investment of the town according to the
      prescribed modes.

      His men were placed under canvas, and working under the protection of
      immense shields, supported on posts, they made a ditch around the walls,
      strengthening it with a palisade. The king constructed also on the east
      side a fort which he called &ldquo;Manakhpirrî-holds-the-Asiatics.&rdquo; Famine soon
      told on the demoralised citizens, and their surrender brought about the
      submission of the entire country. Most of the countries situated between
      the Jordan and the sea&mdash;Shunem, Cana, Kinnereth, Hazor, Bedippa,
      Laish, Merom, and Acre&mdash;besides the cities of the Haurân&mdash;Hamath,

      The Syrian losses did not amount to more than 83 killed and 400 prisoners,
      showing how easily they had been routed; but they had abandoned
      considerable supplies, all of which had fallen into the hands of the
      victors. Some 724 chariots, 2041 mares, 200 suits of armour, 602 bows, the
      tent of the Prince of Qodshû with its poles of cypress inlaid with gold,
      besides oxen, cows, goats, and more than 20,000 sheep, were among the
      spoil. Before quitting the plain of Bsdraelon, the king caused an official
      survey of it to be made, and had the harvest reaped. It yielded 208,000
      bushels of wheat, not taking into account what had been looted or damaged
      by the marauding soldiery. The return homewards of the Egyptians must have
      resembled the exodus of some emigrating tribe rather than the progress of
      a regular army
    </p>
    <p>
      Thûtmosis caused a long list of the vanquished to be engraved on the walls
      of the temple which he was building at Karnak, thus affording the good
      people of Thebes an opportunity for the first time of reading on the
      monuments the titles of the king&rsquo;s Syrian subjects written in
      hieroglyphics. One hundred and nineteen names follow each other in
      unbroken succession, some of them representing mere villages, while others
      denoted powerful nations; the catalogue, however, was not to end even
      here. Having once set out on a career of conquest, the Pharaoh had no
      inclination to lay aside his arms. From the XXIIth year of his reign to
      that of his death, we have a record of twelve military expeditions, all of
      which he led in person. Southern Syria was conquered at the outset&mdash;the
      whole of Kharû as far as the Lake of Grennesareth, and the Amorite power
      was broken at one blow.

      The three succeeding campaigns consolidated the rule of Egypt in the
      country of the Negeb, which lay to the south-west of the Dead Sea, in
      Phoenicia, which prudently resigned itself to its fate, and in that part
      of Lotanii occupying the northern part of the basin of the Orontes.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * We know of these three campaigns from the indirect
     testimony of the Annals, which end in the year XXIX. with
     the mention of the fifth campaign. The only dated one is
     referred to the year XXV., and we know of that of the Negeb
     only by the <i>Inscription of Amenemhabî</i>, 11. 3-5: the
     campaign began in the Negeb of Judah, but the king carried
     it to Naharaim the same year.

    <p>
      None of these expeditions appear to have been marked by any successes
      comparable to the victory at Megiddo, for the coalition of the Syrian
      chiefs did not survive the blow which they then sustained; but Qodshû long
      remained the centre of resistance, and the successive defeats which its
      inhabitants suffered never disarmed for more than a short interval the
      hatred which they felt for the Egyptian.

      During these years of glorious activity considerable tribute poured in to
      both Memphis and Thebes; not only ingots of gold and silver, bars and
      blocks of copper and lead, blocks of lapis-lazuli and valuable vases, but
      horses, oxen, sheep, goats, and useful animals of every kind, in addition
      to all of which we find, as in Hâtshopsîtû&rsquo;s reign, the mention of rare
      plants and shrubs brought back from countries traversed by the armies in
      their various expeditions. The Theban priests and <i>savants</i> exhibited
      much interest in such curiosities, and their royal pupil gave orders to
      his generals to collect for their benefit all that appeared either rare or
      novel. They endeavoured to acclimatise the species or the varieties likely
      to be useful, and in order to preserve a record of these experiments, they
      caused a representation of the strange plants or animals to be drawn on
      the walls of one of the chapels which they were then building to one of
      their gods. These pictures may still be seen there in interminable lines,
      portraying the specimens brought from the Upper Lotanû in the XXVth year
      of Thûtmosis, and we are able to distinguish, side by side with many
      plants peculiar to the regions of the Euphrates, others having their
      habitat in the mountains and valleys of tropical Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This return to an aggressive policy on the part of the Egyptians, after
      the weakness they had exhibited during the later period of Hâtshopsîtû&rsquo;s
      regency, seriously disconcerted the Asiatic sovereigns. They had vainly
      flattered themselves that the invasion of Thûtmosis I. was merely the
      caprice of an adventurous prince, and they hoped that when his love of
      enterprise had expended itself, Egypt would permanently withdraw within
      her traditional boundaries, and that the relations of Elam with Babylon,
      Carchemish with Qodshû, and the barbarians of the Persian Gulf with the
      inhabitants of the Iranian table-land would resume their former course.
      This vain delusion was dispelled by the advent of a new Thûtmosis, who
      showed clearly by his actions that he intended to establish and maintain
      the sovereignty of Egypt over the western dependencies, at least, of the
      ancient Chaldæan empire, that is to say, over the countries which bordered
      the middle course of the Euphrates and the coasts of the Mediterranean.
      The audacity of his marches, the valour of his men, the facility with
      which in a few hours he had crushed the assembled forces of half Syria,
      left no room to doubt that he was possessed of personal qualities and
      material resources sufficient to carry out projects of the most ambitious
      character. Babylon, enfeebled by the perpetual dissensions of its Cossæan
      princes, was no longer in a position to contest with him the little
      authority she still retained over the peoples of Naharaim or of
      Coele-Syria; protected by the distance which separated her from the Nile
      valley, she preserved a sullen neutrality, while Assyria hastened to form
      a peaceful alliance with the invading power. Again and again its kings
      sent to Thûtmosis presents in proportion to their resources, and the
      Pharaoh naturally treated their advances as undeniable proofs of their
      voluntary vassalage. Each time that he received from them a gift of metal
      or lapis-lazuli, he proudly recorded their tribute in the annals of his
      reign; and if, in exchange, he sent them some Egyptian product, it was in
      smaller quantities, as might be expected from a lord to his vassal.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The &ldquo;tribute of Assûr&rdquo; is mentioned in this way under the
     years XXIII. and XXIV. The presents sent by the Pharaoh in
     return are not mentioned in any Egyptian text, but there is
     frequent reference to them in the Tel el-Amarna tablets. It
     may be mentioned here that the name of Nineveh does not
     occur on the Egyptian monuments, but only that of the town
     Nîi, in which Champollion wrongly recognised the later
     capital of Assyria.
</pre>
    <p>
      Sometimes there would accompany the convoy, surrounded by an escort of
      slaves and women, some princess, whom the king would place in his harem or
      graciously pass on to one of his children; but when, on the other hand, an
      even distant relative of the Pharaoh was asked in marriage for some king
      on the banks of the Tigris or Euphrates, the request was met with a
      disdainful negative: the daughters of the Sun were of too noble a race to
      stoop to such alliances, and they would count it a humiliation to be sent
      in marriage to a foreign court.

      Free transit on the main road which ran diagonally through Kharû was
      ensured by fortresses constructed at strategic points,* and from this time
      forward Thûtmosis was able to bring the whole force of his army to bear
      upon both Coele-Syria and Naharaim.** He encamped, in the year XXVII., on
      the table-land separating the Afrîn and the Orontes from the Euphrates,
      and from that centre devastated the district of Ûânît,*** which lay to the
      west of Aleppo; then crossing &ldquo;the water of Naharaim&rdquo; in the neighbourhood
      of Carchemish, he penetrated into the heart of Mitanni.

      The following year he reappeared in the same region. Tunipa, which had
      made an obstinate resistance, was taken, together with its king, and 329
      of his nobles were forced to yield themselves prisoners. Thûtmosis &ldquo;with a
      joyous heart&rdquo; was carrying them away captive, when it occurred to him that
      the district of Zahi, which lay away for the most part from the great
      military highroads, was a tempting prey teeming with spoil. The barns were
      stored with wheat and barley, the cellars were filled with wine, the
      harvest was not yet gathered in, and the trees bent under the weight of
      their fruit. Having pillaged Senzaûrû on the Orontes,* he made his way to
      the westwards through the ravine formed by the Ishahr el-Kebîr, and
      descended suddenly on the territory of Arvad. The towns once more escaped
      pillage, but Thutmosis destroyed the harvests, plundered the orchards,
      carried off the cattle, and pitilessly wasted the whole of the maritime
      plain.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Senzaûrû was thought by Ebers to be &ldquo;the double Tyre.&rdquo;
      Brugsch considered it to be Tyre itself. It is, I believe,
     the Sizara of classical writers, the Shaizar of the Arabs,
     and is mentioned in one of the Tel el-Amarna tablets in
     connection with Nîi.

      There was such abundance within the camp that the men were continually
      getting drunk, and spent their time in anointing themselves with oil,
      which they could do only in Egypt at the most solemn festivals. They
      returned to Syria in the year XXX., and their good fortune again favoured
      them. The stubborn Qodshû was harshly dealt with; Simyra and Arvad, which
      hitherto had held their own, now opened their gates to him; the lords of
      Upper Lotanû poured in their contributions without delay, and gave up
      their sons and brothers as hostages. In the year XXXI., the city of Anamut
      in Tikhisa, on the shores of Lake Msrana, yielded in its turn;* on the 3rd
      of Pakhons, the anniversary of his coronation, the Lotanû renewed their
      homage to him in person.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The site of the Tikhisa country is imperfectly defined.
     Nisrana was seemingly applied to the marshy lake into which
     the Koweik flows, and it is perhaps to be found in the name
     Kin-nesrîn. In this case Tikhisa would be the country near
     the lake; the district of the Grseco-Roruan Chalkis is
     situated on the right of the military road.
</pre>
    <p>
      The return of the expedition was a sort of triumphal procession. At every
      halting-place the troops found quarters and provisions prepared for them,
      bread and cakes, perfumes, oil, wine, and honey being provided in such
      quantities that they were obliged on their departure to leave the greater
      part behind them. The scribes took advantage of this peaceful state of
      affairs to draw up minute accounts of the products of Lotanû&mdash;corn,
      barley, millet, fruits, and various kinds of oil&mdash;prompted doubtless
      by the desire to arrive at a fairly just apportionment of the tribute.
      Indeed, the results of the expedition were considered so satisfactory that
      they were recorded on a special monument dedicated in the palace at
      Thebes. The names of the towns and peoples might change with every war,
      but the spoils suffered no diminution. In the year XXXIII., the kingdoms
      situated to the west of the Euphrates were so far pacified that Thutmosis
      was able without risk to carry his arms to Mesopotamia. He entered the
      country by the fords of Carchemish, near to the spot where his
      grandfather, Thutmosis I., had erected his stele half a century
      previously. He placed another beside this, and a third to the eastward to
      mark the point to which he had extended the frontier of his empire.. The
      Mitanni, who exercised a sort of hegemony over the whole of Naharaim, were
      this time the objects of his attack. Thirty-two of their towns fell one
      after another, their kings were taken captive and the walls of their
      cities were razed, without any serious resistance. The battalions of the
      enemy were dispersed at the first shock, and Pharaoh &ldquo;pursued them for the
      space of a mile, without one of them daring to look behind him, for they
      thought only of escape, and fled before him like a flock of goats.&rdquo;
       Thutmosis pushed forward as far certainly as the Balikh, and perhaps on to
      the Khabur or even to the Hermus; and as he approached the frontier, the
      king of Singar, a vassal of Assyria, sent him presents of lapis-lazuli.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this prince had retired, another chief, the lord of the Great Kkati,
      whose territory had not even been threatened by the invaders, deemed it
      prudent to follow the example of the petty princes of the plain of the
      Euphrates, and despatched envoys to the Pharaoh bearing presents of no
      great value, but testifying to his desire to live on good terms with
      Egypt. Still further on, the inhabitants of Nîi begged the king&rsquo;s
      acceptance of a troop of slaves and two hundred and sixty mares; he
      remained among them long enough to erect a stele commemorating his
      triumph, and to indulge in one of those extensive hunts which were the
      delight of Oriental monarchs. The country abounded in elephants. The
      soldiers were employed as beaters, and the king and his court succeeded in
      killing one hundred and twenty head of big game, whose tusks were added to
      the spoils. These numbers indicate how the extinction of such animals in
      these parts was brought about. Beyond these regions, again, the sheikhs of
      the Lamnaniû came to meet the Pharaoh. They were a poor people, and had
      but little to offer, but among their gifts were some birds of a species
      unknown to the Egyptians, and two geese, with which, however, His Majesty
      deigned to be satisfied.*

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
